             <p>DEDICATION.</p> <p>TO DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</p> <p>WHEN I was ask'd to whom I should dedicate these volumes, I carelessly answered to no one - Why not? (replied the person who put the question to me.) Because most dedications look like begging a protection</p>
            <pb n="vi" xml:id="pb-vi" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>to the book. Perhaps a worse interpretation may be given to it. No, no! already so much obliged, I cannot, will not, put another tax upon the generosity of any friend of Mr. Sterne's, or mine. I went home to my lodgings, and gratitude warmed my heart to such a pitch, that I vow'd that if they should be dedicated to the man my father so much admired - who, with an unprejudiced eye, read, and approved his works, and moreover loved the man - 'Tis to Mr. Garrick</p>
            <pb n="vii" xml:id="pb-vii" facs="#i13"/>
             <p>then, that I dedicate these Genuine Letters.</p> <p>Can I forget the sweet* Epitaph which proved Mr. Garrick's friendship, and opinion of him? 'Twas a tribute to friendship - and as a tribute of my gratitude I dedicate these volumes to a man of understanding and feelings - had I had him at my elbow, what additional help</p> <note> what follows is  a footnote</note> <p>* See Page II.</p>
            <pb n="viii" xml:id="pb-viii" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>should I have had! but 'twas impossible - Receive this, as it is meant - May you, dear Sir, approve of these letters, as much as Mr. Sterne admired you - but Mr. Garrick, with all his urbanity, can never carry the point half so far, for Mr. Sterne was an enthusiast, if it is possible to be one, in favour of Mr. Garrick.</p> <p>This may appear a very simple dedication, but Mr. Garrick will judge by his own sensibility,</p>
            <pb n="ix" xml:id="pb-ix" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>that I can feel more than I can express, and I believe he will give me credit for all my grateful acknowledgements.</p> <p>I am, with every sentiment of gratitude, and esteem,</p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>Your obliged</p> <p>humble servant,</p> <p>London,</p> <p>June, 1775.</p> <p>Lydia Sterne de Medalle.</p>

             <p>PREFACE.</p> <p>IN publishing these Letters the Editor does but comply with her mother's request, which was, that if any letters were publish'd under Mr. Sterne's name, that those she had in her possession, (as well as those that her father's friends would be kind enough to send to her) should be likewise publish'd --- She depends much</p>
            <pb n="xiv" xml:id="pb-xiv" facs="#i20"/>

Of his skill in delineating and supporting his characters, those of the father of his hero, of his uncle Toby, and of corporal Trim (out of numberless others) afford ample proof: To his power in the pathetic, whoever shall read the stories of Le Fevre, Maria, the Monk, and the dead Ass, must, if he has feelings, bear sufficient testimony: And his Sermons throughout (though sometimes, perhaps, chargeable with a levity not entirely becoming the pulpit) breathe the kindest spirit of Philanthropy, of good will towards man.

             <p>(I believe) Nuttle - though, upon recollection, that was the name of her father-in-law, who was a noted sutler in Flanders, in Queen Ann's wars, where my father married his wife's daughter (N. B. he was in debt to him) which was in September 25, 1711, Old Stile. - This Nuttle had a son by my grandmother - a fine person of a man but a graceless whelp - what became of him I know not. - The family (if any left), live now at Clomwel in the south of Ireland,</p>

             <p>at which town I was born November 24th, 1713, a few days after my mother arrived from Dunkirk. - My birth-day was ominous to my poor father, who was, the day after our arrival, with many other brave officers broke, and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two children - the elder of which was Mary; she was born in Lisle in French Flanders, July the tenth, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, New Stile. - This child was most unfortunate</p>

             <p> - she married one Weemans in Dublin - who used her most unmercifully - spent his substance, became a bankrupt, and left my poor sister to shift for herself, - which she was able to do bit for a few months, for she went to a friend's house in the country, and died of a broken heart. She was a most beautiful woman - of a fine figure, and deserved a better fate. - The regiment, in which my father served, being broke, he left Ireland as soon as I was able to</p>

             <p>be carried, with the rest of his family, and came to the family seat at Elvington, near York, where his mother lived. She was daughter to Sir Roger Jaques, and an heiress. There we sojourned for about ten months, when the regiment was established, and our houshold decamped with bag and baggage for Dublin - within a month of our arrival, my father left us, being ordered to Exeter, where, in a sad winter, my mother and her two children followed him, travelling from</p>

             <p>Liverpool by land to Plymouth. (Melancholy description of this journey not necessary to be transmitted here). In twelve months we were all sent back to Dublin. - My mother, with three of us, (for she laid in at Plymouth of a boy, Joram), took ship at Bristol, for Ireland, and had a narrow escape from being cast away by a leak springing up in the vessel. - At length, after many perils, and struggles, we got to Dublin. - There my father took a large house, furnished it, and in a</p>

We accompanied the regiment, and was driven into Milford Haven, but landed at Bristol, from thence by land to Plymouth again, and to the Isle of Wight - where I remember we stayed encamped some time before</p>

             <p>got into Dublin, and travelled by land to Wicklow, where my father had for some Weeks given us over for lost. - We lived in the barracks at Wicklow, one year, (one thousand seven hundred and twenty) when Devijeher (so called after Colonel Devijeher,) was born; from thence we decamped to stay half a year with Mr. Fetherston, a clergyman, about seven miles from Wicklow, who being a relation of my mother's, invited us to his parsonage at Animo. - It was</p>

             <p>in this parish, during our stay, that I had that wonderful escape in falling through a mill-race whilst the mill was going, and of being taken up unhurt - the story is incredible, but known for truth in all that part of Ireland - where hundred of the common people flocked to see me. - From hence we followed the regiment to Dublin, where we lay in the barracks a year. - In this year, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-one, I learned to write, &amp;c. - The regiment,</p>

             <p>ordered in twenty-two, to Carrickfergus in the north of Ireland; we all decamped, but got no further than Drogheda, thence ordered to Mullengar, forty miles west, where by Providence we stumbled upon a kind relation, a collateral descendant from Archbishop Sterne, who took us all to his castle and kindly entreated us for a year - and sent us to the regiment at Carrickfergus, loaded with kindnesses, &amp;c. - a most rueful and tedious journey had we all, in</p>

             <p>March, to Carrickfergus, where we arrived in six or seven days - little Devijeher here died, he was three years old --- He had been left behind at nurse at a farmhouse near Wicklow, but was fetch'd to us by my father the summer after - another child sent to full his place, Susan; this babe too left us behind in this weary journey - The autumn of that year, or the spring afterwards, (I forget which) my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at school - which he did near Halifax,</p>

To pursue the thread of our story, my father's regiment was the year after ordered to Londonderry, where another sister was brought forth, Catherine, still living, but most unhappily estranged from me by my uncle's wickedness, and her own folly - from this station the regiment was sent to defend Gibraltar,</p>

'Twas there that I commenced a friendship with Mr. H... which has been most lasting on both sides - I then came to York,</p>

I remained near twenty years at Sutton, doing duty at both places ---</p>

             <p>I had then very good health. --- Books, painting, fiddling, and shooting were my amusements; as to the 'Squire of the parish, I cannot say we were upon a very friendly footing -- but at Stillington, the family of the C - s shewed us every kindness -- 'twas most truly agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family, who were ever cordial friends -- In the year 1760, I took a house at York for your mother and yourself, and went up to London to publish my two first</p>

Oh! my L - , thou art kind indeed to make an apology for me, and thou never wilt assuredly repent of one act of kindness - for being thy debtor, I will pay thee with interest. - Why does my L. complain of the desertion of friends? - Where does the human being live that will not join in this complaint? - It is a common observation, and perhaps too true, that married people seldom extend their regards beyond their own fire-side. - There is such a thing as parsimony in esteem, as well as money - </p>

             <p>yet as the one costs nothing, it might be bestowed with more liberality. - We cannot gather grapes from thorns, so we must not expect kind attachments from persons who are wholly folded up in selfish schemes. - I do not know whether I most despise, or pity such characters - nature never made an unkind creature - ill usage, and bad habits, have deformed a fair and lovely creation.</p> <p>My L! - thou art surrounded by all the melancholy gloom of winter; wert thou alone, the retirement would be agreeable. - Disappointed ambition might envy such a retreat, and disappointed</p>

             <p>love would seek it out. - Crouded towns, and busy societies, may delight the unthinking, and the gay - but solitude is the best nurse of wisdom. - Methinks I see my contemplative girl now in the garden, watching the gradual approaches of spring. - Do'st not thou mark with delight the first vernal buds? the snow-drop, and primrose, these early and welcome visitors, spring beneath thy feet. - Flora and Pomona already consider thee as their handmaid; and in a little time will load thee with their sweetest blessing. - The feathered race are all thy own, and with them, untaught harmony will soon begin to</p>

I have re-considered this apology, and, alas!</p>

Arguments, however finely spun, can never change the nature of things --- very true --- so a truce with them.</p> <p>I have lost a very valuable friend by a sad accident, and what is worse, he has left a widow and five young children to lament this sudden stroke. -- If real usefulness and integrity of heart, could have secured him from this, his friends would not now be mourning his untimely fate. --- These dark and seemingly cruel dispensations of Providence, often make the best of human hearts complain. --- Who can paint the distress of an affectionate mother,</p>
            <pb n="46" xml:id="pb-46" facs="#i72"/>
             <p>made a widow in a moment, weeping in bitterness over a numerous, helpless, and fatherless offspring? --- God! these are thy chastisements, and require (hard task!) a pious acquiescence.</p> <p>Forgive me this digression, and allow me to drop a tear over a departed friend; and what is more excellent, an honest man. My L! thou wilt feel all that kindness can inspire in the death of - The event was sudden, and thy gentle spirit would be more alarmed on that account. --- But my L. thou hast less to lament, as old age was creeping on, and her period of doing good, and being useful, was</p>

It is like parting with an old friend, whose temper and company one has long been acquainted with. --- I think</p>
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i74"/>
             <p>I see you looking twenty times a day at the house --- almost counting every brick and pane of glass, and telling them at the same time with a sigh, you are going to leave them. --- Oh happy modification of matter! they will remain insensible of thy loss. --- But how wilt thou be able to part with thy garden? --- The recollection of so many pleasing walks must have endeared it to you. The trees, the shrubs, the flowers, which thou reared with thy own hands --- will they not droop and fade away sooner upon thy departure. --- Who will be the successor to nurse them in thy absence. --- Thou wilt leave thy name upon the myrtle-tree.</p>
            <pb n="49" xml:id="pb-49" facs="#i75"/>
             <p> - If trees, and shrubs, and flowers, could compose an elegy, I should expect a very plaintive one upon this subject.</p> <p>Adieu, adieu. Believe me ever, ever thine,</p> <p>L. STERNE.</p>

             <p>LETTER V.</p> <p>To S - C - , Esq.</p> <p>London, Christmas Day.</p> <p>My Dear Friend,</p> <p>I HAVE been in such a continual hurry since the moment I arrived here --- what with my books, and what with visiters, and visitings, that it was not in my power sooner to sit down and acknowledge the favour of your obliging letter; and to thank you for the most friendly motives which led you to write it: I am not much in pain upon what gives my kind friends at Stillington so much</p>
            <pb n="51" xml:id="pb-51" facs="#i77"/>
             <p>on the chapter of Noses --- because, as the principal satire throughout that part is levelled at those learned block-heads who, in all ages, have wasted their time and much learning upon points as foolish --- it shifts off the idea of what you fear, to another point --- and 'tis thought here very good --- 'twill pass muster --- I mean not with all --- no --- no! I shall be attacked and pelted, either from cellars or garrets, write what I will --- and besides, must expect to have a party against me of many hundreds --- who either do not --- or will not laugh. --- 'Tis enough if I divide the world; --- at least I will rest contented with it. - I wish you was</p>

             <p>here to see what changes of looks and political reasoning, have taken place in every company, and coffee-house since last year; we shall be soon Prussians and Anti-Prussians, B - 's and Anti-B - s, and those distinctions will just do as well as Whig and Tory --- and for aught I know serve the same ends. - The K. seems resolved to bring all things back to their original principles, and to stop the torrent of corruption and laziness. - He rises every morning at six to do business - rides out at eight to a minute, returns at nine to give himself up to his people. - By persisting, 'tis thought he will oblige</p>

             <p>His M.......s and dependants, to dispatch affairs with him many hours sooner than of late - and 'tis much to be question'd whether they will not be enabled to wait upon him sooner by being free'd from long levees of their own, and applications; which will in all likelyhood be transferr'd from them directly to himself - the present system being to remove that Phalanx of great people, which stood betwixt the throne and the subjects, and suffer them to have immediate access without the intervention of a caball - (this is the language of others): however the K. gives every thing himself, knows every thing, and weighs every thing maturely,</p>
            <pb n="54" xml:id="pb-54" facs="#i80"/>

             <p>me; and from time to time will send you an account of whatever may be worth transmitting. - The stream now sets in strong against the German war. Loud complaints of - - - making a trade of the war, &amp;c. &amp;c. much expected from Ld. G - 's evidence to these matters, who is expected every hour; the K. wins every day upon the people, shews himself much at the play, (but at no opera) rides out with his brothers every morning, half an hour after seven, till nine - returns with them - spends an hour with them at breakfast, and chat - and then sits</p>

             <p>down to business. I never dined at home once since I arrived - an fourteen dinners deep engaged just now, and fear matters will be worse with me in that point than better. - As to the main points in view, at which you hint - all I can say is, that I see my way, and unless Old Nick throws the dice --- shall, in due time, come off winner. - Tristram will be out the twentieth - there is a great rout made about him before he enters the stage --- whether this will be of use or no, I can't say -- some wits of the first magnitude here, both as to wit and station, engage me success - time will shew ---</p>

             <p>LETTER VII.</p> <p>To the same.</p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>I THIS moment received the favour of your kind letter. --- The letter in the Ladies Magazine about me, was wrote by the noted Dr. H - , who wrote the Inspector, and who undertakes that magazine --- the people of York are very uncharitable to suppose any man so gross a beast as to pen such a character of himself. - In this great town no soul ever suspected it, for a thousand</p>
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i87"/>
             <p>reasons - could they suppose I should be such a fool as to fall foul upon Dr. W - n, my best friend, by representing him so weak a man - or by telling such a lye of him - as his giving me a purse, to buy off his tutorship for Tristram! - or I should be fool enough to own I had taken his purse for that purpose!</p> <p>You must know there is a quarrel between Dr. H - and Dr. M - y, who was the physician meant at Mr. C - S - 's, and Dr. H - has changed the place on purpose to give M - y a lick. --- Now that conversation, (tho' perhaps true) yet happen'd</p>
            <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i88"/>
             <p>at another place, and with another physician; which I have contradicted in this city for the honour of my friend M - y, all which shews the absurdity of York credulity, and nonesense. Besides the account is full of falshoods - first with regard to the place of my birth, which was at C - , in Ireland - the story of a hundred pounds to Mrs. W - , not true, or of a pension promised; the merit of which I disclaim'd -- and indeed there are so many other things so untrue, and unlikely to come from me, that the worst enemy I have here never had a suspicion --- and to end all Dr. H - owns the paper.</p>
            <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i89"/>
             <p>I shall be down before May is out --- I preach before the Judges on Sunday --- my sermons come out on Thursday after --- and I purpose the Monday at furthest after that to set out for York --- I have bought a pair of horses for that purpose --- my best respects to your Lady ---</p> <p>I am,</p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>Your most obliged and faithful,</p> <p>L.

            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i90"/>
             <p>P.S. I beg pardon for this hasty scrawl, having just come from a Concert where the D.. of Y... perform'd -- I have received great notice from him, and last week had the honour of supping with him.</p>

             <p>LETTER VIII.</p> <p>To the same.</p> <p>Dear Sir,</p> <p>SINCE I had the favour of your obliging letter, nothing has happened, or been said one day, which has not been contradicted the next; so having little certain to write, I have forbore writing at all, in hopes every day of something worth filling up a letter. We had the greatest expectations yesterday that ever were</p>
            <pb n="66" xml:id="pb-66" facs="#i92"/>
             <p>raised, of a pitched battle in the H - of C - , wherein Mr. P - was to have entered and thrown down the gauntlet, in defence of the German war. - There never was so full a house - the gallery full to the top - I was there all the day - when, lo! a political fit of the gout seized the great combattant - he entered not the lists - B... got up, and begged the house, as he saw not his right honourable friend there, to put off the debate - it could not be done; so B... rose up, and made a most long, passionate, incoherent speech, in defence of the Germanick war - but very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was carried</p>
            <pb n="67" xml:id="pb-67" facs="#i93"/>
             <p>on - in which he addressed himself principally to the C - of the E - , and laid him on terribly. - it seems the chancery of Hanover had laid out 350,000 pounds, on account, and brought in our treasury debtor - and the grand debate was, for an honest examination of the particulars of this extravagant account, and for vouchers to authenticate it. - L... answered B... very rationally, and coolly - Lord N. spoke long - Sir F. D - maintained the German was most pernicious - Mr. C - , of Surry, spoke well against the account, with some others - L. B - n at last got up, and spoke half an hour</p>
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i94"/>
             <p>with great plainness, and temper - explained a great many hidden springs relating to these accounts, in favour of the late K. - and told two or three conversations which had passed between the K. and himself, relative to these expences - which cast great honour upon the K's. character. This was with regard to the money the K. had secretly furnished out of his pocket to lessen the account of the Hanover-score brought us to discharge.</p> <p>B - d and B - n abused all who sought for peace, and joined in the cry for it; and B - d added, that the reasons of wishing a peace</p>
            <pb n="69" xml:id="pb-69" facs="#i95"/>
             <p>now, were the same as at the peace of Utretch - that the people behind the curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too, so were for making another sacrifice of the nation, to their own interests. - After all - the cry for a peace is so general, that it will certainly end in one. Now for myself. - </p> <p>One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies --- the best is, they abuse and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.</p>

             <p>I am going down for a day or two with Mr. Spencer, to Wimbleton; on Wednesday there is to be a grand assembly at Lady N - . I have enquired every where about Stephen's affair, and can hear nothing --- My friend, Mr. Charles T - , will be now secretary of war --- he bid me wish him joy of it, though not in possession. --- I will ask him --- and depend, my most worthy friend, that you shall not be ignorant of what I learn from him --- believe me ever, ever,</p> <p>Yours,</p> <p>L.S.</p>

             <p>LETTER IX.</p> <p>To the same.</p> <p>My dear Sir,</p> <p>A STRAIN which I got in my wrist by a terrible fall, prevented my acknowledging the favour of your obliging letter. I went yesterday morning to breakfast with Mr. V - , who is a kind of right-hand man to the secretary, on purpose to enquire about the propriety, or feasibility, of doing what you wish me - and he has</p>
            <pb n="72" xml:id="pb-72" facs="#i98"/>
             <p>told me an anecdote which, had you been here, would, I think, have made it wiser to have deferred speaking about the affair a month hence than now; it is this - You must know that the numbers of officers who have left their regiments in Germany, for the pleasures of the town, have been a long topic for merriment; as you see them in St. James's Coffee-house, and the park, every hour, enquiring, open mouth, how things go on in Germany, and what news? -- when they should have been there to have furnished news themselves - but the worst part has been, that many of them have left their brother officers on their</p>
            <pb n="73" xml:id="pb-73" facs="#i99"/>
             <p>duty, and in all the fatigues of it, and have come with no end but to make friends, to be put unfairly over the heads of those who were left risking their lives. - In this attempt there have been some but too successful, which has justly raised ill-blood and complaints from the officers who staid behind --- the upshot has been, that they have every soul been ordered off, and woe be to him ('tis said) who shall be found listening. Now just to mention our friend's case whilst this cry is on foot, I think would be doing more hurt than good, but if you think otherwise, I will go on with all my heart and mention it to Mr.</p>
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i100"/>
             <p>T..., for to do more I am too inconsiderable a person to pretend to. You made me and my friends here very merry with the accounts current at York, of my being forbid the court --- but they do not consider what a considerable person they make of me, when they suppose either my going, or my not going there, is a point ever enters the K's head --- and for those about him, I have the honour either to stand so personally well known to them; or to be so well represented by those of the first rank, as to fear no accident of that kind.</p>
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i101"/>
             <p>I thank God (B...'s excepted) I have never yet made a friend, or connection I have forfeited, or done ought to forfeit --- but on the contrary, my true character is better understood, and where I had one friend last year, who did me honour, I have three now. --- If my enemies knew that by this rage of abuse, and ill will, they were effectually serving the interests both of myself, and works, they would be more quiet --- but it has been the fate of my betters, who have found, that they way to fame, is like the way to heaven -- through much tribulation --- and till I shall have the honour to be</p>

             <p>my compliments to Mrs. C... and all friends, and believe me, with the greatest fidelity,</p> <p>Your ever obliged,</p> <p>L. STERNE.</p> <p>P.S.

I declare I have considered the wisdom, and foundation of it over and over again, as dispassionately and charitably as a good Christian can, and, after all, I can find nothing in it, or make more of it, than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse, put into Latin by some pedant, to be chanted by some hypocrite to the end of the world, for the consolation of departing lechers. --- 'Tis, I own, Latin; and I think that is all the weight it has --- for, in plain English, 'tis a loose and futile position</p>
            <pb n="86" xml:id="pb-86" facs="#i112"/>
             <p>below a dispute --- "you are not to speak any thing of the dead, but what is good." Why so? --- Who says so? --- neither reason or scripture. --- Inspired authors have done otherwise --- and reason and common sense tell me, that if the characters of past ages and men are to be drawn at all, they are to be drawn like themselves; that is, with their excellencies, and with their foibles --- and it is as much a piece of justice to the world, and to virtue too, to do the one, as the other. --- The ruleing passion et les egarements du coeur, are the very things which mark, and distinguish a man's character; --- in which I would as soon leave out a</p>
            <pb n="87" xml:id="pb-87" facs="#i113"/>
             <p>man's head as his hobby-horse. --- However, if like the poor devil of a painter, we must conform to this pious canon, de mortuis, &amp;c. which I own has a spice of piety in the sound of it, and be obliged to paint both our angels and our devils out of the same pot --- I then infer that our Sydenhams, and Sangrados, our Lucretias, --- and Massalinas, our Sommers, and our Bolingbrokes --- are alike entitled to statues, and all the historians, or satirists who have said otherwise since they departed this life, from Sallust, to S - e, are guilty of the crimes you charge me with, "cowardice and injustice."</p>
            <pb n="88" xml:id="pb-88" facs="#i114"/>
             <p>But why cowardice? "because 'tis not courage to attack a dead man who can't defend himself." - But why do you doctors of the faculty attack such a one with your incision knife? Oh! for the good of the living. - 'Tis my plea. - But I have something more to say in my behalf --- and it is this --- I am not guilty of the charge --- tho' defensible. I have not cut up Doctor Kunastrokius at all --- I have just scratch'd him --- and that scarce skin-deep. --- I do him first honour --- speak of Kunastrokius as a great man --- (be he who he will) and then most distantly hint at a drole foible in his character --- and that not first reported</p>
            <pb n="89" xml:id="pb-89" facs="#i115"/>
             <p>(to the few who can even understand the hint) by me --- but known before by every chamber-maid and footman within the bills of mortality --- but Kunastrokius, you say, was a great man --- 'tis that very circumstance which makes the pleasantry --- for I could name at this instant a score of honest gentlemen who might have done the very thing which Kunastrokius did, and seen no joke in it at all --- as to the failing of Kunstrokius, which you say can only be imputed to his friends as a misfortune --- I see nothing like a misfortune in it to any friend or relation of Kunastrokius --- that Kunastrokius</p>
            <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i116"/>
             <p>upon occasions should sit with *** **** and ******* -  I have put these stars not to hurt your worship's delicacy --- If Kunastrokius after all is too sacred a character to be even smiled at, (which is all I have done) he has had better luck than his betters: --- In the same page (without imputation of cowardice) I have said as much of a man of twice his wisdom --- and that is Solomon, of whom I have made the same remark "That they were both great men --- and like all mortal men had each their ruling passion.</p>
            <pb n="91" xml:id="pb-91" facs="#i117"/>
             <p> - The consolation you give me, "That my book however will be read enough to answer my design of raising a tax upon the public" --- is very unconsolatory --- to say nothing how very mortifying! by h - n! an author is worse treated than a common ***** at this rate --- "You will get a penny by your sins, and that's enough." --- Upon this chapter let me comment. --- That I proposed laying the world under contribution when I set pen to paper --- is what I own, and I suppose I may be allow'd to have that view in my head in common with every other writer, to make my labour of advantage to myself.</p>
            <pb n="92" xml:id="pb-92" facs="#i118"/>
             <p>Do not you do the same? but I beg I may add, that whatever views I had of that kind, I had other views --- the first of which was, the hopes of doing the world good by ridiculing what I thought deserving of it - or of disservice to sound learning, &amp;c. - how I have succeeded my book must shew --- and this I leave entirely to the world - but not to that little world of your acquaintance, whose opinion, and sentiments you call the general opinion of the best judges without exception, who all affirm (you say) that my book cannot be put into the hands of any woman of character. (I hope you except widows, doctor - for they are</p>

             <p>not all so squeamish - but I am told they are all really of my party in return for some good offices done their interests in the 176th page of my second volume) But for the chaste married, and chaste unmarried part of the sex - they must not read my book! Heaven forbid the stock of chastity should be lessen'd by the life and opinions of Tristram Shandy --- yes, his opinions - it would certainly debauch 'em! God take them under his protection in this fiery trial, and send us plenty of Duenas to watch the workings of their humours, 'till they have safely got thro' the whole work. --- If this will not be sufficient, may we have plenty</p>

             <p>protest, first that my end was honest, and secondly, that I wrote not be fed, but to be famous. I am much obliged to Mr. Garrick for his very favourable opinion - but why, dear Sir, had he done better in finding fault with it than in commending it? to humble me? an author is not so soon humbled as you imagine - no, but to make the book better by castrations - that is still sub judice, and I can assure you upon this chapter, that the very passages, and descriptions you propose, that I should sacrifice in my second edition, are what are best relish'd by men of wit, and some others whom I esteem as sound criticks - so that upon</p>

             <p>the whole, I am still kept up, if not above fear, at least above despair, and have seen enough to shew me the folly of an attempt of castrating my book to the prudish humours of particulars. I believe the short cut would be to publish this letter at the beginning of the third volume, as an apology for the first and second. I was sorry to find a censure upon the insincerity of some of my friends - I have no reason myself to reproach any one man - my friends have continued in the same opinions of my books which they first gave me of it - many indeed have</p>

             <p>return to your Lordship for the generosity of your protection, and advice to me, by making a good use of the one, I will hope to deserve the other; I wish your Lordship all the health and happiness in this world, for I am</p> <p>Your Lordship's</p> <p>Most obliged and</p> <p>Most grateful Servant,</p> <p>L.

             <p>LETTER XIV.</p> <p>To the Rev. Mr. STERNE.</p> <p>Prior-Park, June 15, 1760.</p> <p>Reverend Sir,</p> <p>I HAVE your favour of the 9th Instant, and am glad to understand, you are got safe home, and employ'd again in your proper studies and amusements. You have it in your power to make that, which is an amusement to yourself and others, useful to both: at least, you should above all things, beware of its becoming hurtful to either, by any violations of</p>
            <pb n="101" xml:id="pb-101" facs="#i127"/>
             <p>decency and good manners; but I have already taken such repeated liberties of advising you on that head, that to say more would be needless, or perhaps unacceptable.</p> <p>Whoever is, in any way, well received by the public, is sure to be annoy'd by the pest of the public, profligate scribblers. This is the common lot of successful adventurers; but such have often a worse evil to struggle with, I mean the over-officiousness of their indiscreet friends. There are two Odes, as they are call'd, printed by Dodsley. Whoever was the author, he appears to be a</p>
            <pb n="102" xml:id="pb-102" facs="#i128"/>
             <p>monster of impiety and lewdness - yet such is the malignity of the scribblers, some have given them to your friend Hall; and others, which is still more impossible, to yourself; tho' the first Ode has the insolence to place you both in a mean and a ridiculous light. But this might arise from a tale equally groundless and maglignant, that you had shewn them to your acquaintances in M. S. before they were given to the public. Nor was their being printed by Dodsley the likeliest means of discrediting the calumny.</p> <p>About this time, another, under the mask of friendship, pretended to draw</p>

Pray have you read it, or do you know its author?</p> <p>But of all these things, I dare say Mr. Garrick, whose prudence is equal to his honesty or his talents, has remonstrated to you with the freedom of a friend. He knows the inconstancy of what is called the Public, towards all, even the best intentioned, of those</p>

             <p>who contribute to its pleasure, or amusement. he (as every man of honour and discretion would) has availed himself of the public favour, to regulate the taste, and, in his proper station, to reform the manners of the fashionable world; while by a well judged oeconomy, he has provided against the temptations of a mean and servile dependency, on the follies and vices of the great.</p> <p>In a word, be assured, there is no one more sincerely wishes your welfare and happiness, than,</p> <p>Reverend Sir,</p> <p>W.

             <p>LETTER XIV.</p> <p>To my Witty Widow, Mrs. F - .</p> <p>Coxwould, Aug. 3, 1760.</p> <p>Madam,</p> <p>WHEN a man's brains are as dry as a squeez'd Orange -- and he feels he has no more conceit in him than a Mallet, 'tis in vain to think of sitting down, and writing a letter to a lady of your wit, unless in the honest John-Trot-Stile of, yours of the 15th instant came safe to hand, &amp;c. which, by the bye, looks like a letter of business; and you know very well, from the first</p>

             <p>letter I had the honour to write to you, I am a man of no business at all. This vile plight I found my genius in, was the reason I have told Mr. - , I would not write to you till the next post - hopeing, by that time to get some small recruit, at least of vivacity, if not wit, to set out with; - but upon second thoughts, thinking a bad letter in season - to be better than a good one, out of it - this scrawl is the consequence, which, if you will burn the moment you get it - I promise to send you a fine set essay in the stile of your female epistolizers, cut and trim'd at all points. - God defend me from such, who never yet knew what it was to</p>
            <pb n="107" xml:id="pb-107" facs="#i133"/>
             <p>say or write one premeditated word in my whole life --- for this reason I send you with pleasure, because wrote with the careless irregularity of an easy heart. - Who told you Garrick wrote the medley for Beard? -- 'Twas wrote in his house, however, and before I left town. - I deny it --- I was not lost two days before I left town. --- I was lost all the time I was there, and never found till I got to this Shandy castle of mine. --- Next winter I intend to sojourn amongst you with more decorum, and will neither be lost or found any where.</p>
            <pb n="108" xml:id="pb-108" facs="#i134"/>
             <p>Now I wish to God, I was at your elbow - I have just finished one volume of Shandy, and I want to read it to some one who I know can taste and relish humour - this by the way, is a little impudent in me - for I take the thing for granted, which their high mightinesses the world have yet to determine - but I mean no such thing - I could wish only to have your opinion - shall I, in truth, give you mine? - I dare not - but I will; provided you keep it to yourself - know then, that I think there is more laughable humour, - with equal degree of Cervantick satire - if not more than in the last - but we are bad judges of the merit of our children.</p>
            <pb n="109" xml:id="pb-109" facs="#i135"/>
             <p>I return you a thousand thanks for your friendly congratulations upon my habitation - and I will take care, you shall never wish me but well, for I am, madam,</p> <p>With great esteem and truth,</p> <p>Your most obliged</p> <p>L. STERNE.</p> <p>P.S. I have wrote this so vilely and so precipitately, i fear you must carry it to a decypherer - I beg you'll do me the honour to write - otherwise</p>

'Tis a very agreeable ride out in the chaise, I purchased for my wife. --Lyd has a poney which she delights in. - Whilst they take these diversions, I am scribbling away at my Tristram. There two volumes are, I think, the best. - I shall write as long as I live, 'tis, in fact, my hobby-horse: and so much am I delighted with my uncle Toby's imaginary character, that I am become an enthusiast. --- My Lydia</p>

Tristram was almost as much known here as in London, at least among your men of condition and learning, and has got me introduced into so many circles ('tis comme a Londres.)

Indeed I am very ill, having broke a vessel in my lungs - hard writing in the summer, together with preaching, which I have not strength for, is ever fatal to me - but I cannot avoid the latter yet, and the former is too pleasurable to be given up --- I believe</p>

            <p>I shall try if the south of France will not be of service to me --- his G. of Y. has most humanely given me the permission for a year of two --- I shall set off with great hopes of its efficacy, and shall write to my wife and daughter to come and join me at Paris, else my stay could not be so long --- "Le Fever's story has beguiled your ladyship of your tears," and the thought of the accusing spirit flying up heaven's chancery with the oath, you are kind enough to say is sublime --- my friend, Mr. Garrick, thinks so too, and I am most vain of his approbation --- your ladyship's opinion adds not a little to my vanity.</p>

            <p>I wish I had time to take a little excursion to Bath, were it only to thank you for all the obliging things you say in your letter --- but 'tis impossible --- accept at least my warmest thanks --- If I could tempt my friend, Mr. H. to come to France, I should be truly happy --- If I can be of any service to you at Paris, command him who is, and ever will be,</p> <p>Your Ladyship's faithful,</p> <p>L.

I have ten thousand things to tell you, I cannot write --- I do a thousand things which cut no figure, but in the doing --- and as in London, I have the honour of having done and said a thousand things I never did or dream'd of - and yet I dream abundantly --- If the devil stood behind me in the shape of a courier, I could not write faster than I do, having five letters more to dispatch by the same Gentleman; he is going into another section of the globe, and when has seen you, he will depart in peace.</p> <p>The Duke of Orleans has suffered my portrait to be added to the number</p>

            <p>a woman is but simply pleased --- 'tis Je suis charmeÃ© --- and if she is charmed 'tis nothing less, than that she is ravi-sh'd --- and when ravi-sh'd, (which may happen) there is nothing left for her but to fly to the other world for a metaphor, and swear, qu'elle etoit toute extasieÃ© ---- which mode of speaking, is, by the bye, here creeping into use, and there is scarce a woman who understands the bon ton, but is seven times a day in downright extasy --- that is, the devil's in her --- by a small mistake of one world for the other ---- Now, where am I got?</p>

            <p>I have been these two days reading a tragedy, given me by a lady of talents, to read and conjecture if it would do for you --- 'Tis from the plan of Diderot, and possibly half a translation of it --- The Natural Son, or, the Triumph of Virtue, in five acts --- It has too much sentiment in it, (at least for me) the speeches too long, and savour too much of preaching --- this may be a second reason, it is not to my taste --- 'Tis all love, love, love, throughout, without much separation in the character; so I fear it would not do for your stage, and perhaps for the very reason which recommend it to a French one. --- After a vile suspension</p>

            <p>of three weeks - we are beginning with our comedies and operas again - yours I hear never flourished more - here the comic actors were never so low - the tragedians hold up their heads - in all senses. I have known one little man support the theatrical world, like a David Atlas, upon his shoulders, but Preville can't do half as much here, though Mad. Clairon stands by him, and sets her back to his - she is very great, however, and highly improved since you saw her - she also supports her dignity at table, and has her public day every Thursday, when she gives to eat, (as they say here) to all that are hungry and dry.</p>

            <p>You are much talked of here, and much expected as soon as the peace will let you - these two last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at two great houses where I was at dinner - 'Tis the greatest problem in nature, in this meridian, that one and the same man should possess such tragic and comic powers, and in such an equilibrio, as to divide the world for which of the two nature intended him.</p> <p>Crebillion has made a convention with me, which, if he is not too lazy, will be no bad persiflage - as soon as I get to Thoulouse he has agreed to</p>
