             <p>the moon, and some other of the illiterate planets, they may have exploded every kind of true wit mentioned by Addison. It is evidently for this reason, that in most of the periodical works, which are reckoned universal, and particularly the magazines, we are very seldom troubled with any thing but plain good sense, the best method of making water-gruel, and fattening of capons; which may be of use, and understood all over the world.</p>
             <p>CHAP. II.</p>
             <p>MY good friend, and arch companion Mr. Tristram Shandy, gentlemen, who makes such honourable mention of my learned father, the celebrated doctor Kunastrokius, of physical</p>
             
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>memory* has fallen into this very mistake that I have just been mentioning; and, by a certain subtility of thinking, and quaintness of expression, the beauties and excellencies of his work, may not only be passed over by many of the inhabitants of Asia-minor, Monomotapa, some of the Mickmacs, Cherokees, and Catawbas, but, at least, by seven hundred and fifty of the inhabitants of London, and Westminster, the Borough of Southwark, and parts adjacent.</p>
             <p>This computation, which I did not make myself, may appear at first, somewhat too exact, but the reader may be persuaded I have it from the best authority, - my printer, who assures me, I cannot sell more or less than that number:</p>

             <p>I own I was at first of another opinion, and therefore ordered him to print twenty thousand; but he soon convinced me of my mistake, by the cartloads of waste-paper in his shop, so that I now set down to write for the seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers of Tristram Shandy, in and about the purlicus of this metropolis, - and no other.</p>
             <p>CHAP III.</p>
             <p>TO them be it known, then, that Mr. Tristram Shandy is one of the greatest moralists, and most refined politicians this, or any other age whatever has produced.</p>
             
            <pb n="8" xml:id="pb-8" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>CHAP. IV.</p>
             <p>BEFORE we enter upon the illustration of these round assertions, it will be necessary to point out the qualifications of a moralist. He should have a fundamental knowledge of ethics, or that science which fixes the oeconomy and conduct of human Life, that teaches the regulation of the passions, and instructs men to be happy, by practising all the social virtues. He should know how to adapt these rules to the various subjects he treats of, and point out such evident and uncontrovertable conclusions in favour of morality, as every unbiassed reader must be sensible of the effect.</p>
             
            <pb n="9" xml:id="pb-9" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>CHAP. V.</p>
             <p>A Moralist has generally one, two, three, four, five, six, and sometimes more things in view. Those of the singular number, write for writing's sake: those of the first plural number, invert the rule of oeconomy, "a penny saved is a penny got," and think, that in getting a penny, they do more than save one they have not, - so that they make writing and eating go hand in hand. The triple number have generally some new moral doctrine to broach, and, with the two former con-committants, add, that of self-opinionated public service. Then come the controvertists to these, and the recontrovertists, with</p>
             
            <pb n="10" xml:id="pb-10" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>their answers, replies, and rejoinders, ad infinitum. - But, before I launch out any further in the definition of a moral writer, I must inform my seven hundred and fifty readers that Mr. Tristram Shandy is not among any of these classes. - He stands by himself upon the top shelf of ethics, - tho' but in twelves, - unrivalled, - inimitable, - and (to my seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers) incomprehensible. He must, therefore, be more fully explained than any of the foregoing moralists, - and, for that reasons, I allow him best part of the following sheets for his public defence to the moral world.</p>
             <p>CHAP. VI.</p>
             <p>THE first evident mark of Mr. Tristram's morals (which indeed</p>
             
            <pb n="11" xml:id="pb-11" facs="#i17"/>

Regularity every one knows is the corner-stone of virtue - and virtue is the foundation of morality - Thus far, then, Mr. Shandy goes on in a moral track to give us the history of his anti-birth.</p>
             <p>But what does the winding up of the clock allude to - and how comes it this thought always entered his mother's head once a month? This he very naturally accounts for by an assemblage of ideas, according to Locke; and whatever it may want in decency, he very notably makes up by sound philosophy and his little men* in embrio - according</p>

            <pb n="12" xml:id="pb-12" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>to the oeconomy of human life, and consistant with moral duties.</p>
             <p>CHAP. VII.</p>
             <p>IT would be difficult for me, and tedious for my readers, to trace Mr. Tristram Shandy though every part of his moral character: I shall therefore confine myself to such traits as are the most striking (tho' not self-evident) and least understood.</p>
             <p>Among these the following passage seems next to claim our attention. "The rituals direct the baptizing of the child, in case of danger, before it is born; but upon this proviso, that some part or other of the child's body be seen by the baptiser: but the</p>
             
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>doctors of the Sorbonne, by deliberation, held amongst them April 10, 1733, have enlarged the powers of the midwives, by determining, that though no part of the child's body should appear, - that baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection by means of a little squirt. 'Tis very strange that St. Thomas Aquinas, who had so good a mechanical head, both for tying and untying, the knots of school-divinity, shou'd, after so much pains bestowed upon this - give up the point at last, as a thing impossible."</p>
             <p>Here follows the question upon baptism, with the consultation of the doctors of the Sorbonne thereupon in French; but as Mr. Shandy has not favoured us with a translation, and as very likely</p>
             
            <pb n="14" xml:id="pb-14" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>some of my incomprehensible readers may not understand that language, I have rendered it in English. - Those of my readers, who (notwithstanding their incomprehensibility) have a smattering of the Gallican tongue, and fancy they comprehend the whole affair in the original, have nothing to do but skip to chapter 9, and fancy there is no such thing as chapter 8 in this whole book, - I mean volume.</p>
             <p>CHAP. VIII.</p>
             <p>A Memorial presented to the doctors of the Sorbonne. "A Surgeon and man-midwife represents to the gentlemen of the Sorbonne, that there are some cases, though very uncommon, wherein a mother cannot</p>
             
            <pb n="15" xml:id="pb-15" facs="#i21"/>
             <p>be delivered, and when even the child is so inclosed int he mother's womb, that no part of it's body appears, in which case, according to the rituals, baptism should be conferred to it, at least, upon conditions. The surgeon, who makes this representation, engages, by means of a syringe, to baptize immediately the child, without any way hurting the mother. The question he asks is, whether this method he proposes, is allowable and legal, and if he may follow it in a case parallel to that which he represents?"</p>
             <p>The answer to the foregoing memorial:</p>
             <p>"The council is of opinion, that the question proposed has many difficulties</p>
             
            <pb n="16" xml:id="pb-16" facs="#i22"/>
             <p>to be first removed. The theologists have on one side established a principle, that baptism, which is a spiritual birth, supposes a prior birth; we must be born into the world to be reborn in Jesus Christ, according to their doctrine. St. Thomas, part. 3. quaest. 88. article 11. follows this opinion as an established fact: we cannot (says that holy doctor) baptize children which are inclosed in their mothers wombs. By this St. Thomas means these children are not born, and therefore cannot be reckoned amongst other men: from whence he infers they cannot be the object of an external action, to receive thereby the sacraments necessary to salvation: <note>Latin</note>Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodicerunt in lucem ut cum aliis himinibus vitam ducant, undenon</p>
             
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i23"/>
             <p>possunt subjici actioni humanae, ut per corum ministerum sacramenta recipiant ad sulutem. The rituals enforce the practice of what theologists have regulated upon those heads and they unanimously prohibit the baptising of children which are inclosed in their mothers wombs, if no part of their bodies appears. The concurrence of the theologists and the rituals, which are the rules of the diocesses, seems to establish an authority necessary to answer the present question: however, the council of conscience, considering on the one hand, that the reasonings of the theologists is entirely founded upno their desire of conformity, and that the prohibition of the rituals, supposes, that children so inclosed, cannot be baptized in their mothers wombs, which is against the present supposition; and,</p>
             
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i24"/>
             <p>on the other hand, considering that the same theologians teach, that the Sacraments which Jesus Christ has established, as the easy, but necessary means of sanctifying man, may be hazarded; and besides, supposing that children inclosed in their mothers wombs are capable of salvation, as they are liable to damnation; upon these considerations, and having an eye to the memorial, wherein it is assured, that a certain method is found out, of baptizing children thus inclosed, without occasioning the least prejudice to the mother; the council imagines, that the means proposed may be made use of, in the belief that God has not left this kind of children without any resource, and supposing, according to the representation, that the means there proposed are porper to procure them baptism,</p>
             
            <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>nevertheless, as by authorizing the proposed practice, a rule universally established must be cancelled, the council thinks, that the memoralists should make application to his bishop, whose province it is to judge of the utility and danger of the method proposed, and as (under the direction of the bishop) the council thinks that recourse should be had to the pope, in whom the right of explaining the laws of the church, and of derogating therefrom, where they cannot be executed is invested: and, however ingenious and useful the manner of baptism here proposed may be, the council cannot give their approbation to it, without the concurrence of these two authorities. The memorialist is, at least, advised to apply to his bishop, and to inform him of the present decision, that in case the prelate should</p>
             
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>coincide with the reasons, whereupon the under-signed have founded their opinions, he may be authorized in cases of necessity, when too much time may be lost to ask permission, and have it granted, for following the method proposed, so advantageous to the child's salvation. The council has nothing further to add, than, that notwithstanding they believe this method may be pursued, are nevertheless of opinion, that in case the children in question should come into the world, contrary to the expectation of those who have used this method, it would be necessary to baptize them upon condition; and this is conformable to all the rituals, which in authorizing the baptism of a child, some part of whose body appears, enjoins at the same time, and orders it's baptism</p>
             
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i27"/>
             <p>upon condition, in case it comes happily into the world."</p>
             <p>Deliberated in the Sorbonne, the 10th of April, 1733.</p>

             <p>DE MARCILLY.</p>
             <p>CHAP. IX.</p>
             <p>I Suppose, by this time every one of my readers (French readers, or English readers) understands clearly and perspicuously, the representation or memorial of the French man-midwife, and the answer of the doctors of the Sorbonne thereto; and in this opinion too (before any English translation is given) Mr. Tristram Shandy gives his compliments to those doctors, in the following words:</p>
             
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i28"/>
             <p>"Mr. Tristram Shandy's compliments to Messrs. Le Moyne, De Romigny and De Marcilly, hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a consultation. - He begs to know, whether, after the ceremony of marriage, and before that of consummation, the baptizing all the HOMUNCULI at once, slap-dash, by injection, would not be a shorter and safer cut still, on condition, as above, that if the HOMUNCULI do well, and come safe into the world after this, that each and every of them shall be baptized again (on condition) - and provided, in the second place, that the thing can be done, which Mr. Shandy apprehends it may, by means of a syringe, and without any prejudice tot he father."</p>
             
            <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i29"/>
             <p>This, and the foregoing passages, are what I propose labouring hard to rescue from the claws of moral (though pseudo) critics, who would insinuate, that they are not only directly inconsistent with all morality, but evidently antichristian. As to you, my worthy (though incomprehensible) readers, I dare say, no such thoughts ever entered your brain, nor indeed how should they, for what immorality can there be in giving the substance of a theological dispute, especially when every thing that can possibly give offence is expressed in a foreign tongue?</p>
             <p>The latter part of this conclusion, or query, or whatever you please to call it, I do not so much insist upon, as in that case I should share the guilt, if there were any, with my friend Tristram</p>
             
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i30"/>
             <p>Shandy, for having exposed him in English. Therefore, having said all I can say, in defence of his morals and orthodoxy, in this respect. I beg you will conclude with me, that in this part he no ways deviates from his general moral character.</p>
             <p>This, I think, is reasoning (ay, and sound reasoning too) enough for one chapter - and so we proceed to the next.</p>
             <p>CHAP. X.</p>
             <p>THIS chapter, though entirely upon modesty, cannot properly be called a modest chapter, notwithstanding there is very little of the author's vanity</p>
             
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i31"/>
             <p>in it: therefore any of my seven hundred and fifty readers (being females) may pass it over, if they chuse it, and my lazy readers in particular, (of either gender, the epicene not excluded) are carefully recommended to avoid it, as perhaps after all they will have occasion to recur to a dictionary, or be obliged to say their A, B, C, numerically before they understand it.</p>
             <p>- "Then it can be out of nothing in the world, quoth my uncle Toby, int he simplicity of his heart - but MODESTY. - My sister, I dare say, added he, does not care to let a man come so near her ****.:"*</p>
             <p>One would be inclined to imagine, that a man of my friend Tristram's strict</p>

             <p>morals had concluded the sentence before the asterisms, and that they were a meer error of the press, though they had run through two editions, if he had not immediately after added"</p>
             <p>- "My sister, may hap," quoth my uncle Toby, "does not chuse to let a man come so near her ****, make this dash, - 'tis an aposiopesis - Take the dash away, and write backside - 'tis bawdy. - Scratch backside out, and put cover'd way in, - 'tis a metaphor; - and I dare say, as fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby's head, that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence, - that word was it."â </p>
             <p><note>footnote</note>â Vide p. 49. vol. 2.</p>
             
            <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i33"/>
             <p>Notwithstanding my strict reliance upon Tristram's veracity, and my great opinion of his uncle Toby's purity of expression, I cannot be induced to believe that his uncle Toby either said backside, bawdy or not bawdy, or was metaphorically inclined to express himself in a covered way. - Naked truth, I believe, he thought the best - four asterisms are but four asterisms - and ever since asterisms have been in use, we have always been taught that their number should be supplied by a like number of letters to make out the sense.</p>
             <p>Curious, indefatigable, unblushing readers, consider what letters will properly supply the place, without infringing upon the sense. - Mind I have already exploded uncle Toby's "backside" and "covered way." - What do you think</p>

             <p>CHAP. XI.</p>
             <p>THIS chapter I intend to devote entirely to hobby horses.</p>
             <p>A hobby-horse is a machine which boys (ay, and girls too) frequently sit astride upon, and which going up and down affords them much amusement.</p>
             
            <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i35"/>
             <p>Mr. Tristram Shandy's hobby-horse I take to be ****, (four asterisms) as explained in Chap. X. and his favourite argument the argumentum ad rem, as he applies it in page 139, volume the 1st of his work.</p>
             <p>My hobby horse is a goose quill, upon which I have rode through life to this period, and by which I hope to get hobby-horsically to my journey's end without much fatigue.</p>
             <p>N.B. My hobby-hose never goes on so briskly as upon a journey of prescriptions and receipts - for, instead of paying upon the first road, I receive toll; and the last excursion I seldom make but for the sale of some young hobby, the offspring of my goose quill, which never stumbles without I meet with a lady, when</p>
             
            <pb n="30" xml:id="pb-30" facs="#i36"/>
             <p>I get out of the way of the two first syllables of my name, and canter on simple Strokius - though to be sure there is no more resemblance between a K and a C, than there is between my hobby-horse and a lady's pad.</p>
             <p>CHAP XII.</p>
             <p>THE foregoing chapters will give my readers a very competent idea of Mr. Tristram Shandy's morality and religion; for though there may be some few slips of the pen, particularly where the four asterism are left to supply the place of a word, the drift of this work evidently appears to be moral and orthodox, particularly the last, which is manifestly evinced by his scheme of baptizing slap dash (to use his own words) all mankind,</p>
             
            <pb n="31" xml:id="pb-31" facs="#i37"/>
             <p>even before they are born, and thereby prevent any heretical, or schismatical opinions (except in the matters of faith) whatever.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XIII.</p>
             <p>I AM now going to consider my friend Tristram Shandy as a politician - or rather, as he is considered by the greatest politicians of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.</p>
             <p>This, it must be owned, is an arduous task; - but my title page is already printed, and I cannot deviate from it; but before I begin, I make this solemn protestation, that if any of the writers of our weekly political papers, either composed of a sheet and a half, to avoid the</p>

             <p>N.B. Every part of this, and these foregoing chapters, extends to all the magazines (which I did intend to allot a chapter to enumerate) as well as the reviews, - without they make very favourable mention of me, and this my elaborate work.</p>

             <p>A Politician is truly an amphibious animal, - and in England he is more inclined to the herring than the monkey; - it is quite otherwise in France, where it is more requisite for a professed politicians to have learnt to dance, than to have read Machiavel, for his arguments are better enforced by a caper, - <note>French</note>a pas grave, or a balonÃ©, than by the most Syllogistic logic of all the schools, Un politique de Paris, (that is, Paris Politician) enters a coffee room with a pas de posse piÃ©, makes three entrechae at the front looking-glass, goes up to the group, tells them, with a significant air, "nous F-ns bien le tour aux Anglois cette campaigne - ces fiers insulaires sauront, bien tÃ´t faire respect au genie</p>

               <p>Here Mr. Profound made a pause, after which - he addressed himself to us - Well, gentlemen, what do you think of this great political writer - you may talk of your Machiavel's, and your Sommers's,</p>

"Another political reason (says Tristram) prompted my father so strongly to guard against the least evil accident in my mother's lying-in in the country, - was, That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power, too great already, into the weaker vessels of the gentry, in his own or higher stations; - which, with the many usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishing, - would, in the end, prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestic government established in the first creation of things by God."</p>

               <p>What can he mean here, (resumed Mr. Profound) but pecuniary influence in elections, particularly in boroughs? and yet there is not one in a hundred takes it in that sense. I tell you, gentlemen, Tristram Shandy is one compleat system of modern politics, and that to understand him, there is as much occasion for a key, as there is for a catalogue to the Harleian library: I own, that I should not myself have penetrated so far as I have, notwithstanding my great reading in works of this nature, if I had not had the opportunity of supping the other evening with the author, who let me into the whole affair. I advised him to publish a key, but he told me it was too dangerous. - What is the Siege of Namur, which he often mentions, but the Siege of Fort St. Philip's in Minorca?</p>

               <p>- or, the wound his uncle Toby received there but the distress the nation was thrown into thereupon? His application to the study of fortification, and the knowledge he therein gained, means nothing else but the rectitude and clear sightedness of the administration which afterwards took up the reins of government. This is a master piece of allegory, beyond all the poets of this or any period whatever. There is but one fault to be found with Mr. Tristram Shandy as a politician - that is making Yorick's horse so lean - but then he is armed at all points - I think too he should have told us the horse was white, to have made the symbolical application: - but he did not dare declare himself so openly upon this head - he told me so.

               <p>WHEN Mr. Profound had got thus far, a fit of coughing took him, which I was apprehensive would very near have carried him off. - I waited with great patience hear a quarter of an hour till he had recovered himself, in expectation of having gained fro him an explanation of this passage, which he certainly would have given, notwithstanding he told us in the beginning he would leave us to our own reflections; but how unluckily mortifying was it, both for you and me, readers, that after the fit left him, there was not a sufficient number of auditors remaining to form a committee, and Mr. Profound went away as much out of temper with his cough as with his company.</p>
               
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i54"/>
               <p>I have regularly attended the house for above a fortnight past, in expectation of meeting him, when (tears speak my grief!) I yesterday learned he died the night before - and all my hopes of an explanation of this passage are at an end.</p>
               <p>I propose erecting here a monument to the memory of Profound, in the same manner as Tristram has to that of Yorick.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXI.</p>
               <p>SOME of the most comprehensible of my readers must have observed, that I have scattered very little Greek and Latin about this work, and that I have even made shift with an English motto, notwithstanding a classical one is so essential to the well understanding and recommending a book, even though of this consequence. - To be honest, I must own, that none of the family of the Kunastrokius's were any great Grecians, - and, as to Latin, I always found it a very saleable commodity at the physical-market. But if any of my readers should be desirous to divert themselves with a Greek or Latin quotation, I would advise them to read me with Homer, Herodotus, Virgil, Horace, and a few more of</p>
               
            <pb n="52" xml:id="pb-52" facs="#i58"/>
               <p>the classics by their sides, and if they understand them, not else, - they have nothing to do, but now and then dip into one or other of them, and please themselves, and save me a great deal of unnecessary trouble.</p>
               <p>CHAP. XXII.</p>
               <p>THIS chapter is intirely upon propriety, and must, therefore, of course, (with or without a pun) be a very proper chapter.</p>
               <p>Digressions are the soul of a work, as Mr. Tristram Shandy has very judiciously discovered, and he has a tenaciously adhered to this discovery; - wherefore, he may, with the greatest propriety, by stiled the king of episodical writers.</p>
               
            <pb n="53" xml:id="pb-53" facs="#i59"/>
               <p>As to absurdities, it is absurd to suppose, there can be any in a work of humour, - true humour I mean. - I appeal to all and every one of my incomprehensible readers, if there by any absurdity in the work now before them: - I will answer for you all in one word - none. In regard to my friend Tristram, what are generally reckoned absurdities in him, are his greatest beauties - Though he ridicules plates and cuts by a ridiculous stamp, may he not, with great propriety prefix a frontispiece to his second edition? - Every one must own, that a frontispiece, when executed by a masterly hand, is an embellishment to a work; - and who can be so out of the way, as to find fault with an embellishment, which evidently inhances the value of the production? </p>
               
            <pb n="54" xml:id="pb-54" facs="#i60"/>
               <p>Again, with respect to dedications. - Though that in the middle of his first volume certainly means (if any thing) a burlesque upon dedications of what nature so ever, yet we find in his second edition, he has dedicated this moral-political (not bawdy, ludicrous, as some may imagine it) piece, to one of the most respectable characters in England. - But who can take offence at it?</p>
               <p>What I have said in this chapter concerning Mr. Tristram Shandy's propriety, sets some of the mistaken errors of that work in the clearest points of light, in which my readers (incomprehensible as they are) must certainly view them.</p>
               
            <pb n="55" xml:id="pb-55" facs="#i61"/>
               <p>CHAP. XXIII.</p>
               <p>LIKE most other writers, when I have nothing more to say, I draw near a conclusion; but as it is necessary, for several reasons which I could explain if I chose (but not having promised it in my title page I am not compelled to it,) to eke out another chapter, I must say something, if it be only to contradict what I have hitherto said; - but this I shall not do, and so continuous as follows:</p>
               <p>If, after all, I have not sufficiently cleared my friend Tristram Shandy, from any attacks of the false critics, for want of morals, or for any small heresy in politics: - no part of this can be laid to his charge, - as he was then unborn, as he still remains, in a literal sense.</p>
               
            <pb n="56" xml:id="pb-56" facs="#i62"/>
               <p>But to wave all considerations of this nature, my readers, as incomprehensible as they are, must have perceived e'er now, that Tristram Shandy is the most excellent (I was going to say -est, by the way of a superlative superlative, suitable to the occasion) piece that has appeared for many years; besides, according to Hubras, -</p>
               <p>- The worth of everything,<lb/>
               Is just as much as it will bring, -</p>
               <p>and this is the dearest production to the bookseller, if not to the public, that has appeared for near half a centry.</p>

               <p>AS I expect, in consequence of the foregoing work, to receive invitations on every hand for parties of pleasure, regales, dinners, and suppers - in order to prevent confusion in my engagements, and that I may not make appointments with persons I am intirely ignorant of, I beg they would, with all convenient dispatch, send their titles,</p>
