             <p>TO</p> <p>HENRY SMITH, Esq.</p> <p>SECRETARY TO THE HON. THE BOARD OF ORDNANCE,</p> <p>IN THE</p> <p>KINGDOM OF IRELAND.</p> <p>SIR,</p> <p>A DEDICATION wears, at all times, so much the air of flattery, that 'tis hard to distinguish between the language dictated by Sincerity, and the fawnings of the Parasite - between the respect paid by personal gratitude to personal merit, and the awkward imitations of it offered at the foot of Wealth and Title by the hungry expectant.</p> <p>I shall, for these reasons, only make one short observation on the propriety of my offering these sheets to your patronage - That although nothing doubting but the</p>
            <pb n="iv" xml:id="pb-iv" facs="#i10"/>
             <p>innate beauty of my favorite author, is capable of attracting the admiration and seizing the attention of every rank and age - yet having had an opportunity (through the honor of a personal intimacy with you) of observing, not only how reducible, but reduced to practice, is that philanthropy he so sweetly recommends in every page of his writings, - I have been induced to pre-fix your name, as a fit head to such a body - feeling with what force precept comes home to the heart, strengthen'd by such an example.</p> <p>I have therefore to beg you will attribute the liberty I here take with your name to its proper motive - a desire to hold up to the world a mirror, in which they should endeavor to behold their own likeness - and believe me, with every sentiment of gratitude and respect,</p> <p>SIR,</p> <p>Your most obliged,</p> <p>And most humble servant,</p> <p>A. F.</p>
            <pb n="v" xml:id="pb-v" facs="#i11"/>
             <p>PREFACE.</p> <p>THE very many editions that have already passed the press, of the "Beauties of Sterne," sufficiently evince the sentiments of the public at large upon the propriety of such a work, and remove those objections which at first might have been supposed to exist - it therefore only remains to point out the amendments the world has a right to look for in the present edition.</p> <p>It has been a matter of much general complaint, that the selections hitherto made were of rather too confined a cast, - and that, contrary to the original, the utile and the dulce, were not sufficiently blended, or in equal quantities. That as the work was intended both for the recreation of our riper years, and the improvement of the more juvenile mind, it dragg'd on rather too serious a system of grave morality, unmix'd with those sprightlier sallies of fancy,</p>
            <pb n="vi" xml:id="pb-vi" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>which the great Original knew so judiciously and equally to scatter in our way.</p> <p>It has been likewise observed, that the dread of offending the ear of Chastity, so laudable in itself, has, in the present case, been carried to an excess, thereby depriving us of many most laughable scenes, though in themselves totally free from my objections on the score of indelicacy - and that, upon the whole, the past compilers of Sterne, keeping their eye rather upon his morality, than his humour - upon his judgment, than his wit, had liken'd the work to his Cane Chair, deprived of the one of its knobbs - incomplete and ununiform. - Giving us rather those plants which may be found in all climates and in every soil, than those which are more estimable, because more rare, and which have been brought to perfection in but a very few indeed such skilful hands as his.</p> <p>To obviate in some measure those founded objections, has been the object of the present edition, in which, the reader, whether of a grave or gay complexion, will</p>
            <pb n="vii" xml:id="pb-vii" facs="#i13"/>
             <p>find an equal attention paid him - the sprightly reader will find, now for the first time, several scenes of such exquisite fancy - such true Shandean coloring, that he will be astonish'd, they could be overlook'd by any who professed to enumerate the "Beauties of Sterne." - Such are, Mr. Shandy's Beds of Justice - Dr. Slop and Susannah - Parson Yorick's Horse - and many other pictures of the same tint. - </p> <p>The heart of Sensibility will receive a melancholy pleasure in the contemplation of Yorick's untimely fate; - and the mind, in search of those duties we owe to GOD and MAN, will receive fresh incentives to persevere in well-doing, from that most excellent discourse upon Charity - "The Case of Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath considered." - A few of his most admired Letters are also now added, and the whole embellish'd, at a great expence, with capital engravings from original drawings, executed for this particular purpose.</p> <p>Thus will the reader perceive, that as the mine from whence this gem is extracted</p>
            <pb n="viii" xml:id="pb-viii" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>is by far the richest this country has ever produced, no pains have been spared to render it proportionably superior in brilliancy and sterling value.</p> <p>To promote the interests of Virtue by exhibiting her in her most pleasing attitudes - to seduce, if possible, mankind to pursue that road which alone leads to true happiness, is the warmest wish of the Editor's heart; and he firmly believes, there is no mode so effectual, as strewing such flowers as these in their way - for impenetrable must that heart be which cannot be soften'd by so much good sense, enliven'd with so much good humour.</p>

             <p>MEMOIRS</p> <p>OF THE</p> <p>LIFE AND FAMILY</p> <p>OF THE LATE</p> <p>REV. MR. LAURENCE STERNE.</p> <p>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</p> <p>ROGER STERNE (grandson to Archbishop Sterne) Lieutenant in Handaside's regiment, was married to Agnes Hebert, widow of a captain of a good family: her family name was (I believe) Nuttle - though, upon recollection, that was the name of her father-in-law, who was a noted sutler in Flanders, in Queen Ann's wars, where my father married his wife's daughter (N. B. he was in debt to him) which was in September 25, 1711, Old Style. - This Nuttle had a son by my grand-mother - a</p>
            <pb n="xiv" xml:id="pb-xiv" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>fine person of a man, but a graceless whelp - what became of him I know not - The family (if any left), live now at Clonmel, in the SOuth of Ireland, at which town I was born November 24, 1713, a few days after my mother arrived from Dunkirk. - My birth-day was ominous to my poor father, who was, the day after our arrival, with many other brave officers broke, and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two children - the elder of which was Mary; she was born at Lisle in French Flanders, July the tenth, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, New-Style. - This child was most unfortunate - she married one Weemans in Dublin - who used her most unmercifully - spent his substance, became a bankrupt, and left my poor sister to shift for herself, - which she was able to do but for a few months, for she went to a friend's house in the country, and died of a broken heart. She was a most beautiful woman - of a fine figure, and deserved a better fate. - The regiment in which my father served, being broke, he left Ireland as soon as I was able to be carried, with the rest of his family, and came to the family seat at Elvington, near York, where his mother lived. She was daughter to Sir George Jaques, and an heiress. There we sojourned for about ten months, when</p>
            <pb n="xv" xml:id="pb-xv" facs="#i21"/>
            <p>the regiment was established, and our houshold decamped with bag and baggage for Dublin - within a month of our arrival, my father left us, being ordered to Exeter, where, in a sad winter, my mother and her two children followed him, travelling from Liverpool by land to Plymouth. (Melancholy description of this journey not necessary to be transmitted here). In twelve months we were all sent back to Dublin. - My mother, with three of us (for she laid in at Plymouth of a boy, Joram), took ship at Bristol, for Ireland, and had a narrow escape from being cast away by a leak springing up in the vessel. At length, after many perils and struggles, we got to Dublin. There my father took a large house, furnished it, and in a year and a half's time spent a great day of money. - In the year one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, all unhing'd again; the regiment was ordered, with many others, to the Isle of Wight, in order to embark for Spain, in the Vigo expedition. We accompanied the regiment, and were driven into Milford Haven, but landed at Bristol, from thence by land to Plymouth again, and to the Isle of Wight - where I remember we stayed encamped some time before the embarkation of the troops - (in this expedition from Bristol to Hampshire we</p>

We had poor Joram's loss supplied during our stay in the Isle of Wight, by the birth of a girl, Anne, born September the twenty-third, one thousand seven hundred and nineteen. - This pretty blossom fell at the age of three years, in the barracks of Dublin - she was, as I well remember, of a fine delicate frame, not made to last long, as were most of my father's babes. We embarked for Dublin, and had all been cast away by a most violent storm, but through the intercessions of my mother, the captain was prevailed upon to turn back into Wales, where we stayed a month, and at length got into Dublin, and travelled by land to Wicklow, where my father had for some weeks given us over for lost. - We lived in the barracks at Wicklow, one year (one thousand seven hundred and twenty) when Devijeher (so called after Colonel Devijeher) was born; from thence we decamped to stay half a year with Mr. Fetherston, a clergyman, about seven miles from Wicklow, who being a relation of my mother's,</p>
            <pb n="xvii" xml:id="pb-xvii" facs="#i23"/>
            <p>invited us to his parsonage at Animo. - It was in this parish, during our stay, that I had that wonderful escape in falling through a mill-race whilst the mill was going, and of bieng taken up unhurt - the story is incredible, but known for truth in all that part of Ireland - where hundreds of the common people flocked to see me. - From hence we followed the regiment to Dublin, where we lay in the barracks a year. In this year, one thousand seven hnndred and twenty-one, I learned to write, &amp;c. The regiment ordered in twenty-two, to Carrickfergus in the north of Ireland; we all decamped, but go no further than Drogheda, thence ordered to Mullengar, forty miles west, where by Providence we stumbled upon a kind relation, a collateral descendant from Archbishop Sterne, who took us all to his castle, and kindly entertained us for a year - and sent us to the regiment at Carrickfergus, loaded with kindnesses, &amp;c. - a most rueful and tedious journey had we all, in March, to Carrikfergus, where we arrived in six or seven days - little Devijeher here died, he was three years old - He had been left behind at nurse at a farm-house near Wicklow, but was fetch'd to us by my father the summer after - another child sent to fill his place, Susan; this babe too left us behind</p>

            <p>in this journey - The autumn of that year, or the spring afterwards (I forget which) my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at school - which he did near Halifax, with an able master; with whom I staid some time, till by God's care of me, my cousin Sterne, of Elvington, became a father to me, and sent me to the university, &amp;c. &amp;c. To pursue the thread of our story, my father's regiment was the year after ordered to Londonderry, where another sister was brought forth, Catherine, still living, but most unhappily estranged from me by my uncle's wickedness, and her own folly - From this station the regiment was sent to defend Gibraltar, at the siege, where my father was run through the body by Captain Phillips, in a duel (the quarrel began about a goose) with much difficulty he survived - though with a partial constitution, which was not able to withstand the hardships it was put to - for he was sent to Jamaica, where he soon fell by the country fever, which took away his senses first, and made a child of him, and then, in a month or two, walking about continually without complaining, till the moment he sat down in an arm chair, and breathed his last - which was at Port Antonio, on the north of the island. - My father was a little smart man</p>

STERNE, for which the usher severely whipped me. My master was very much hurt at this, and said, before me, that never should that name be effaced, for I was a boy of genius, and he was sure I should come to preferment - this expression made me forget the stripes I had received. - In the year thirty-two*</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>*He was admitted of Jesus College, in the university of Cambridge, 6th July, 1733, under the tuition of Mr. Cannon.</p> <p>Matriculated 29th March, 1735.</p> <p>Admitted to the degree of B.A. in January, 1736.</p> <p> - M.A. at the Commencement, 1740.</p>

            <p>my cousin sent me to the university, where I staid some time. 'Twas there that I com-commenced a friendship with Mr. H... which has been most lasting on both sides - I then came to York, and my uncle got me the living of Sutton - and at York I became acquainted with your mother, and courted her for two years - she owned she liked me, but thought herself not rich enough, or me too poor, to be joined together - she went to her sister's in S-, and I wrote to her often - I believe then she was partly determined to have me, but would not say so - at her return she fell into a consumption - and one evening that I was sitting by her with an almost broken heart to see her so ill, she said, "My dear Laurey, I can never be yours, for I verily believe I have not long to live - but I have left you every shilling of my fortune;" - upon that she shewed me her will --- this generosity overpowered me. It pleased God that she recovered, and I married her in the year 1741. *My uncle and myself were then upon very good terms, for he soon got me the Prebendary of York - but he quarrelled with me afterwards, because</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Jaques Sterne, LL.D.

            <p>AS Mr. Sterne, in the foregoing narrative, hath brought down the account of himself untill within a few months of his death, it remains only to mention that he left York about the end of the year 1767, and came to London in order to publish The Sentimental Journey, which he had written during the preceding summer at his fa-fourite living at Coxwold. His health had been for some time declining, but he continued to visit his friends, and retained his usual flow of spirits. In February, 1768, he began to perceive the approaches of death, and with the concern of a good man, and the solicitude of an affectionate parent, devoted his attention to the future welfare of his daughter. His letters at this period reflect so much credit to his character, that it is to be lamented some others in the collection were permitted to see the the light. After a short struggle with his disorder, his debilitated and worn out frame submitted to fate on the 18th day of March, 1786, at his lodgings in Bond-street. He was buried at the new burying-ground, belonging to the parish of St. George, Hanover-square, on the 22d of the same month, in the most private manner; and hath since been indebted to strangers for a monument very unworthy</p>

Save her from all accidents of a dangerous element, and give her comfort at the last.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* This Lady's name was Draper, wife of Daniel Draper, Esq; of Bombay.</p>

            <p>My prayer, Eliza, I hope, is heard; for the sky seems to smile upon me, as I look up to it. I am just returned from our dear Mrs. James's, where I have been talking of thee for three hours. - She has got your picture, and likes it: but Marriot, and some other judges, agree that mine is the better, and expressive of a sweeter character, but what is that to the original? yet I acknowledge that her's is a picture for the world, and mine is calculated only to please a very sincere friend, or sentimental philosopher. - In the one, you are dressed in smiles, and with all the advantages of silks, pearls, and ermine; - in the other, simple as a vestal - appearing the good girl nature made you; - which, to me, conveys an idea of more unaffected sweetness, than Mrs. Draper, habited for conquest, in a birth-day suit, with her countenance animated, and her dimples visible. - If I remember right, Eliza, you endeavoured to collect every charm of your person into your face, with more than common care, the day you sat for Mrs. James - Your colour, too, brightened; and your eyes shone with more than usual brilliancy. I then requested you to come simply and unadorned when you sat for me - knowing (as I see with unprejudiced eyes) that you could receive no addition from the silk-worm's aid, or jeweller's polish. Let me now tell you a truth, which, I believe, I have uttered before. - When I first saw you, I beheld you as an object of compassion, and as a very plain woman. The mode of your dress, (tho' fashionable) disfigured you. - But nothing</p>
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i43"/>
            <p>now could render you such, but the being solicitous to make yourself admired as a handsome one. - You are not handsome, Eliza, nor is your's a face that will please the tenth part of your beholders, - but are something more; for I scruple not to tell you, I never saw so intelligent, so animated, so good a countenance; nor was there (nor ever will be) that man of sense, tenderness, and feeling, in your company three hours, that was not (or will not be) your admirer, or friend, in consequence of it; that is, if you assume, or assumed, no character foreign to your own, but appeared the artless being nature designed you for. A something in your eyes and voice, you possess in a degree more persuasive than any woman I ever saw, read, or heard of. But it is that bewitching sort of nameless excellence, that men of nice sensibility alone can be touched with.</p> <p>Were your husband in England, I would freely give five hundred pounds (if money could purchase the acquisition), to let you only sit by me two hours in a day, while I wrote my Sentimental Journal. I am sure the work would sell so much the better for it, that I should be reimbursed the sum more than seven times told. - I would not give nine pence for the picture of you, the Newnhams have got executed - It is the resemblance of a conceited, made-up coquet. Your eyes, and the shape of your face (the latter the most perfect oval I ever saw,) which are perfections that must strike the most indifferent judge, because they are equal to any of GOD'S works in a</p>

            <p>similar way, and finer than any I beheld in all my travels, are manifestly injured by the affected leer of the one, and strange appearance of the other; owing to the attitude of the head, which is a proof of the artist's, or your friend's false taste. The ****'s who verify the character I once gave of teazing, or sticking like pitch, or birdlime, sent a card that they would wait on Mrs. **** on Friday. - She sent back, she was engaged. - Then to meet at Ranelagh, to-night. - She answered, she did not go. - She says, if she allows the least footing, she never shall get rid of the acquaintance; which she is resolved to drop at once. She knows they are not her friends, nor yours; and the first use they would make of being with her, would be to sacrifice you to her (if they could) a second time. Let her not then; let her not, my dear, be a greater friend to thee, than thou art to thyself. She begs I will reiterate my request to you, that you will not write to them. It will give her, and thy Bramin, inexpressible pain. Be assured, all this is not without reason on her side. I have my reasons too; the first of which is, that I should grieve to excess, if Eliza wanted that fortitude her Yorick has built so high upon. I said I never more would mention the name to thee; and had I not received it, as a kind of charge, from a dear woman that loves you, I should not have broke my word. I will write again to-morrow to thee, thou best and most endearing of girls! A peaceful night to thee. My spirit will be with thee through every watch of it.</p>

            <p>TO THE SAME.</p> <p>MY DEAREST ELIZA!</p> <p>OH! I grieve for your cabin. - And the fresh painting will be enough to destroy every nerve about thee. Nothing so pernicious as white lead. Take care of yourself, dear girl; and sleep not in it too soon. It will be enough to give you a stroke of an epilepsy. I hope you will have left the ship; and that my Letters may meet, and greet you, as you get out of your post-chaise, at Deal. - When you have got them all, put them, my dear, into some order. - The first eight or nine are numbered: but I wrote the rest without that direction to thee; but thou wilt find them out, by the day or hour, which, I hope, I have generally prefixed to them. When they are got together, in chronological order, few them together in a cover. I trust they will be a perpetual refuge to thee, from time to time; and that thou wilt (when weary of fools, and uninteresting discourse) retire, and converse an hour with them, and me.</p> <p>I have not had power, or the heart, to aim at enlivening any one of them, with a single stroke of wit or humour; but they contain something better; and what you will feel more suited to your situation - a long detail of much advice, truth, and knowledge. I hope, too, you will perceive loose touches of an honest heart, in every one of them; which speak more than the most studied periods; and will give thee more ground of trust and confidence upon Yorick,</p>

            <p>than all that laboured eloquence could supply. Lean then thy whole weight, Eliza, upon them and upon me. "May poverty, distress, anguish, and shame, be my portion, if ever I give thee reason to repent the knowledge of me!" - With this asseveration, made in the presence of a just God, I pray to him, that so it may speed me, as I deal candidly, and honourably with thee! I would not mislead thee, Eliza; I would not injure thee, in the opinion of a single individual, for the richest crown the proudest monarch wears.</p> <p>Remember, that while I have life and power, whatever is mine, you may style, and think, your's -  Though sorry should I be, if ever my friendship was put to the test thus, for your own delicacy's sake. - Money and counters are of equal use in my opinion; they both serve to set up with.</p> <p>I hope you will answer me this letter, but if thou art debarred by the elements, which hurry thee away. I will write one for thee; and knowing it is such a one as thou would'st have written, I will regard it as my Eliza's.</p> <p>Honour, and happiness, and health, and comforts of every kind, sail along with thee, thou most worthy of girls! I will live for thee, and my Lydia - be rich for the children of my heart - gain wisdom, gain fame, and happiness, to share with them - with thee - and her, in my old age. - Once for all, adieu. Preserve thy life; steadily pursue the ends we proposed;</p>

            <p>and let nothing rob thee of those powers Heaven has given thee for thy well-being.</p> <p>What can I add more, in the agitation of mind I am in, and within five minutes of the last postman's bell, but recommend thee to Heaven, and recommend myself to Heaven with thee, in the same fervent ejaculation, "that we may be happy, and meet again; if not in this world, in the next." - Adieu. - I am thine, Eliza, affectionately, and everlastingly,</p> <p>YORICK.</p> <p>THE PRECEPTOR.</p> <p>YOU see 'tis high time, said my father, addressing himself equally to my uncle Toby and Yorick, to take this young creature out of these women's hands, and put him into those of a private governor.</p> <p>Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night, and by which he is to adjust his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heart; - I would have one, Yorick, if possible, polished at all points, fit for my child to look into.</p> <p>There is, continued my father, a certain mein and motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and speaking, which argues a man well within. There are a thousand unnoticed openings, continued my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into a</p>

            <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i49"/>
            <p>lame knee (which sometimes gave him exquisite pain) - when my uncle Toby dined or supped alone he would never suffer the Corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's veneration was such, that with a proper artillery, my uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itself, with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when my uncle Toby supposed the Corporal's leg was at rest, he would look back, and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes for five-and-twenty years together - But this is neither here nor there - why do I mention it? - Ask my pen, - it governs me, - I govern not it.</p> <p>He was one evening sitting thus at supper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glass or two of sack: 'Tis for a poor gentleman - I think of the army, said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house four days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a desire to taste any thing, 'till just now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast: - "I think," says he, taking his hand from his forehead, "it would comfort me." - </p> <p> - If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a thing, - added the landlord, - I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill. - I hope in God he will still mend, continued he, - we are all of us concerned for him.</p>
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i50"/>
            <p>Thou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my uncle Toby; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack thyself, - and take a couple of bottles with my service, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.</p> <p>Though I am persuaded, said my uncle Toby, as the landlord shut the door, he is a very compassionate fellow - Trim, - yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too; there must be something more than common in him, that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his host: - And of his whole family, added the Corporal, for they are all concerned for him. - Step after him, said my uncle Toby, - do, Trim, and ask if he knows his name.</p> <p> - I have quite forgot it, truly, said the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the Corporal, - but I can ask his son again. - Has he a son with him then? said my uncle Toby. - A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age; - but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day: - He has not stirred from bed-side these two days.</p> <p>My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim, without being ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</p>
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i51"/>
            <p>Trim! said my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a visit to this poor gentleman. - Your honour's roquelaure, replied the Corporal, has not once been n, since the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. Nicholas; - and besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, it will be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear so, replied my uncle Toby; but I am not at rest in my mind, Trim, since the account the landlord has given me. - I wish I had not known so much of this affair, - added my uncle Toby, - or that I had known more of it: --- How shall we manage it? Leave it, an't please your honour, to me, quoth the Corporal; - I'll take my hat and stick, and go to the house and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour. - Thou shalt go, Trim, said my uncle Toby, and here's a shilling for thee to drink with his servant. - I shall get it all out of him, said the Corporal, shutting the door.</p> <p>It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked his ashes out of his third pipe, that Corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave him the following account.</p> <p>I despaired, at first, said the Corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any intelligence concerning the poor sick Lieutenant - Is he in the army,</p>
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i52"/>
            <p>then? said my uncle Toby - he is, said the Corporal - And in what regiment? said my uncle Toby - I'll tell your honour, replied the Corporal, every thing straight forward, as I learnt it - Then, Trim, I will fill another pipe, said my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee till thou hast done; so sit down at thy ease, Trim, in the window-seat, and begin thy story again. The Corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it - Your honour is good: And having done that, he sat down, as he was ordered, - and began the story to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the same words.</p> <p>I despaired at first, said the Corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour, about the Lieutenant and his son; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I made myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be asked, - That's a right distinction, Trim, said my uncle Toby - I was answered, an' please your honour, that he had no servant with him; - that he had come to the inn with hired horses, which, finding himself unable to proceed (to join, I suppose, the regiment), he had dismissed the morning after he came. - If I get better, my dear, said he, as he gave his purse to his son t pay the man, - we can hire horses from hence. - But, alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, said the landlady to me, - for I heard the death-watch all night long; - and when he dies, the youth, his son, will certainly die with him; for he is broken-hearted already.</p>
            <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i53"/>
            <p>I was hearing this account, continued the Corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of; - but I will do it for my father myself, said the youth. - Pray let me save you the trouble, young gentleman, said I, taking up a fork for the purpose, and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire, whilst I did it. - I believe, Sir, said he, very modestly, I can please him best myself. - I am sure, said I, his honour will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old soldier. - The youth took hold of my hand, and instantly burst into tears. - Poor youth! said my uncle Toby, - he has been bred up an infant in the army, and the name of a soldier, Trim, sounded in his ears like the name of a friend; - I wish I had him here.</p> <p>- I never in the longest march, said the Corporal, had so great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company: - What could be the matter with me, an' please your honour? Nothing in the world, Trim, said my uncle Toby, blowing his nose, - but that thou art a good natured fellow.</p> <p>When I gave him the toast, continued the Corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shandy's servant, and that your honour (though a stranger) was extremely sorry for his father; - and that if there was any thing in your house or cellar - (and thou might'st have added my purse too, said my uncle Toby,) - he was heartily welcome to it: - He made a very low bow (which was meant to your honour,) but no answer, - for his heart was full - so</p>
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i54"/>
            <p>he went up stairs with the toast; - I warrant you, my dear, said I, as I opened the kitchen door, your father will be well again. - Mr. Yorick's curate was smoaking a pipe by the kitchen fire, - but said not a word good nor bad to comfort the youth. - I thought it wrong, added the Corporal - I think so too, said my uncle Toby.</p> <p>When the Lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he felt himself a little revived, and sent into the kitchen, to let me know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairs. - I believe, said the landlord, he is going to say his prayers, - for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed-side, and as I shut the door, I saw his son take up a cushion. - </p> <p>I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never said your prayers at all. - I heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it - Are you sure of it? replied the curate. - A soldier, an' please your reverence, said I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a parson; - and when he is fighting for his king, and for his life, and for his honour too; he has the most reason to pray to God, of any one in the whole world. - 'Twas well said of thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby. - But when a soldier, said I, an' please your reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water, - or engaged, said I, for months together in long and</p>
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i55"/>
            <p>dangerous marches; harrassed, perhaps, in his rear to day; - harassing others to morrow; - detached here; - countermanded there; - resting this night out upon his arms; - beat up in his shirt the next; - benumbed in his joints; - perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel on; - must say his prayers how and when he can. - I believe, said I, - (for I was piqued, quoth the Corporal, for the reputation of the army) I believe, an' please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets time to pray, - he prays as heartily as a parson, - though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy. Thou shouldst not have said that, trim, said my uncle Toby, - for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not: - At the great and general review of us all, Corporal, at the day of Judgment, (and not till then) - it will be seen who have done their duties in this world, - and who have not; and we shall be advanced, Trim, accordingly. - I hope we shall, said Trim. - It is in the Scripture, said my uncle Toby; and I will shew it thee to-morrow: - In the mean time we may depend upon it, Trim, for our comfort, said my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it, - it will never be enquired into, whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one: - I hope not, said the Corporal. - but go on, Trim, said my uncle Toby, with the story.</p> <p>When I went up, continued the Corporal, into the Lieutenant's room, which I did not do 'till the expiration of the ten minutes, - he was lying in his</p>
            <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i56"/>
            <p>bed, with his head raised upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white handkerchief beside it: - The youth was just stooping down to take up the cushion, upon which I supposed he had been kneeling; - the book was laid upon the bed; - and as he rose, in taking up the cushion with one, he reached out his other to take it away at the same time. Let it remain there, my dear, said the Lieutenant.</p> <p>He did not offer to speak to me, till I had walked u close to his bed-side: If you are Captain Shandy's servant, said he, you must present my thanks to your master, with my little boy's along with them, for his courtesy to me; - if he was of Levens's - said the Lieutenant, - I told him your honour was, - Then, said he, I served three campaigns with him in Flanders, and remember him, - but 'tis most likely, as I had not the honor of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me. - You will tell him, however, that the person his good nature has laid under obligations to him, is one Le Fevre, a Lieutenant in Angus's - but he knows me not, - said he, a second time, musing; - possible he may my story, - added he, - pray tell the Captain, I was the Ensign at Breda, whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket shot, as she lay in my arms in my tent. - I remember the story, an't please your honor, said I, very well. - Do you so? said he, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief; - then well may I. - In saying this, he drew a little ring out of his bosom,</p>
            <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i57"/>
            <p>which seemed tied with a black ribband about his neck, and kiss'd it twice - Here, Billy, said he, - the boy flew across the room to the bed-side, and falling down upon his knee, took the ring in his hand, and kiss'd it too, - then kiss'd his father, and sat down upon the bed and wept.</p> <p>I wish, said my uncle Toby, with a deep sigh, - I wish, Trim, I was asleep.</p> <p>Your honor, replied the Colonel, is too much concerned; - shall I pour your honor out a glass of sack to your pipe? Do, Trim, said my uncle Toby.</p> <p>I remember, said my uncle Toby, sighing again, the story of the Ensign and his wife, - and particularly well that he, as well as she, upon some account or other, (I forget what,) was universally pitied by the whole regiment; but finish the story thou art upon: - 'Tis finished already, said the Corporal, - for I could stay no longer, - so wished his honor a good night; young Le Fevre rose from off the bed, and saw me to the bottom of the stairs; and as we went down together, told me, they had come from Ireland, and were on their route to join the regiment in Flanders. But alas! said the Corporal, - the Lieutenant's last day's march is over. - Then what is to become of his poor boy? cried my uncle Toby.</p> <p>It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honor, that he set aside every other concern, and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor Lieutenant and his son.</p>
            <pb n="28" xml:id="pb-28" facs="#i58"/>
            <p>That kind BEING, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence thee for this!</p> <p>Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the Corporal, as he was putting him to bed, - and I will tell thee in what, Time - In the first place, when thou madest an offer of my services to Le Fevre, - as sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor Lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay, - that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood in need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to it as myself. - Your honor, said the Corporal, I had no orders. - True, quoth my uncle Toby, - thou didst very right, Trim, as a soldier, - but certainly very wrong as a man.</p> <p>In the second place, for which, indeed, tho hast the same excuse, continued my uncle Toby, - when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house, -thou shouldst have offered him my house too: - A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, Trim; and if we had him with us, - we could tend and look to him: - Thou art an excellent nurse thyself, Trim; and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's, his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs. - </p> <p>- In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby, smiling, - he might march. - He will never march, an't please your honor, in this world, said the Corporal: - He will march, said my uncle Toby, rising up from the side of the bed, with one shoe</p>
            <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i59"/>
            <p>off: - An't please your honor, said the Corporal; he will never march, but to his grave: - He shall march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch, - he shall march to his regiment. ----- He cannot stand it, said the Corporal: - He shall be supported said my uncle Toby: - He'll drop at last, said the Corporal, and what will become of his boy? - He shall not drop, said my uncle Toby, firmly. A-well-o'day - do what we can for him, said Trim, maintaining his point, - the poor soul will die: He shall not die, by G--, cried my uncle Toby.</p> <p> - The ACCUSING SPIRIT, which flew up to Heaven's chancery with the oath, blush'd as he gave it in, - and the RECORDING ANGEL, as he wrote it down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.</p> <p> - My uncle Toby went to his bureau, put his purse into his breeches pocket, and having ordered the Corporal to go early in the morning for a physician, - he went to bed and fell asleep.</p> <p>The sun looked bright, the morning after, to every eye in the village but Le Fevre's and his afflicted son's; the hand of death press'd heavy on his eye-lids, - and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle, - when my uncle Toby, who had rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the Lieutenant's room, and without preface or apology, sat himself down upon the chair by the bed-side, and independently of all modes and customs, opened the curtain</p>

The coat my uncle Toby gave the Corporal: - Wear it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor Lieutenant - And this, said my uncle Toby, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke - and this, Le Fevre, I'll save for thee - 'tis all the fortune, my dear Le Fevre, which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world, - and thou doest it like a man of honor, - 'tis enough for us.</p> <p>As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation, he sent him to a public school, where, except Whitsuntide and Christmas, at which times the Corporal was punctually dispatched for him, - he remained to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories</p>

I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight beside me - And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation. -</p> <p>My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the Lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the Corporal to brighten up; - and having detained Le Fevre a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to Leghorn, - he put the sword into his hand: - If thou art brave, Le Fevre, said my uncle Toby, this will not fail thee; - but Fortune, said he, (musing a little) - Fortune may - And if she does, added my uncle Toby, embracing him, come back again to me, Le Fevre, and we will shape thee another course.</p> <p>The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le Fevre, more than my uncle Toby's paternal kindness; - he parted from my uncle Toby, as the best of sons from the best of fathers - both dropped tears - and as my uncle Toby gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into the hand, and big God bless him.</p>

            <p>Le Fevre got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made of, at the defeat of the Turks before Belgrade; but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment, and trod close upon his heels for four years together after: he had withstood these buffetings to the last, 'till sickness overtook him at Marseilles; from whence he wrote my uncle Toby word, he had lost his time, his services, his health, and, in short, every thing but his sword; - and was waiting for the first ship to return back to him.</p> <p>Le Fevre was hourly expected, and was uppermost in my uncle Toby's mind all the time my father was giving him and Yorick a description of what kind of a person he would choose for a preceptor to me: but as my uncle Toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required, he forbore mentioned Le Fevre's name, - till the character, by Yorick's interposition, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of Le Fevre and his interest upon my uncle Toby, so forcibly, he rose instantly off his chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take hold of both my father's hands - I beg, brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby, I may recommend poor Le Fevre's son to you - I beseech you, do, added Yorick - He has a good heart, said my uncle Toby - And a brave one too, an't please your honor, said the Corporal. - The best hearts, Trim, are ever the bravest, replied my uncle Toby.</p> <p>T.

            <p>THE PULSE.</p> <p>PARIS.</p> <p>HAIL, ye small sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight: 'tis ye who open this door, and let the stranger in.</p> <p> - Pray, Madam, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opera Comique: - Most willingly, Monsieur, said she, laying aside her work - </p> <p>I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops, as I came along, in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption; 'till at last, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p> <p>She was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop, facing the door - </p> <p> - TrÃ¨s-volontiers, most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a chair, next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with so cheerful a movement, and so cheerful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis-d'ors with her, I should have said - "This woman is grateful."</p> <p>You must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with me to the door of the shop, and pointing the way down the street I was to take - you must turn first to your left hand - mais prenez garde - there are two turns;</p>
            <pb n="35" xml:id="pb-35" facs="#i65"/>
            <p>and be so good a to take the second - then go down a little way and you'll see a church, and when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the Pont neuf, which you must cross - and there any body will do himself the pleasure to shew you - </p> <p>She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good-natured patience the third time as the first; - and if tones and manners have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to hearts which shut them out - she seemed really interested, that I should not lose myself.</p> <p>I will not suppose it was the woman's beauty, notwithstanding she was the handsomest Griffet, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the sense I had of her courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes, - and that I repeated my thanks, as often as she had done her instructions.</p> <p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot every tittle of what she had said; - so looking back, and seeing her still standing at the door of the shop, as if to look whether I went right or not - I returned back to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or left - for that I had absolutely forgot. - Is it possible> said she, half laughing. - 'Tis very possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice.</p> <p>As this was the real truth - she took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a slight courtesy.</p>
            <pb n="36" xml:id="pb-36" facs="#i66"/>
            <p> - Attendez, said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst she called a lad out of the back shop to get ready a parcel of gloves - I am just going to send him, said she, with a packet into that quarter; and if you will have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a moment, and he shall attend you to the place. So I walked in with her to the far side of the shop, and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she sat down herself in her low chair, and I instantly sat myself down beside her.</p> <p> - He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a moment - And in that moment, replied I, most willingly would I say something very civil to you for all these courtesies. Any one may do a casual act of good-nature, but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature; and certainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart, which descends to the extremes (touching her wrist), I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world - Feel it, said she, holding out her arm. So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two fore-fingers of the other to the artery.</p> <p> - Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me sitting in my black coat, and in my lack-a-day-sical manner, counting the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever - How wouldst thou have laugh'd and</p>
            <pb n="37" xml:id="pb-37" facs="#i67"/>
            <p>moralized upon my new profession! - And thou should'st have laugh's and moralized on - Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said, "There are worse occupations in this world, than feeling a woman's pulse." - But a Griffet's! thou wouldst have said - and in an open shop! Yorick - </p> <p> - So much the better; for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not if all the world saw me feel it.</p> <p>I had counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when her husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop, put me a little out of my reckoning. - 'Twas nobody but her husband, she said, - so I began a fresh score - Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he passed by us, to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse - The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said I did him too much honor - and having said that, he put on his hat and walked out.</p> <p>Good God! said I to myself, as he went out - and can this man be the husband of this woman?</p> <p>Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation, if I explain it to those who do not.</p> <p>In London, a shop-keeper and a shop-keeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh: in the several endowments of mind and body, sometimes the one, sometimes the other has it, so as in general to be upon a par, and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.</p>

            <p>In Paris, there are scarce two orders of beings more different: for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband, he seldom comes there - in some dark and dismal room behind, he sits, commerceless, in his thrum night-cap; the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him.</p> <p>The genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is salique, having ceded this department, with sundry others, totally to the women - y a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night, like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a bag, by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but will receive, some of them, a polish like a brilliant - Monsieur Le Marli is little better than the stone under your foot.</p> <p> - Surely - surely, man! it is not good for thee to sit alone - thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings; and this improvement of our natures from it, I appeal to, as my evidence.</p> <p> - And how does it beat, Monsieur? - said she. - With all the benignity, said I, looking quietly in her eyes, that I expected - She was going to say something civil in return - but the lad came into the shop with the gloves - A propos, said I, I want a couple of pair myself.</p> <p>The beautiful Griffet rose up when I said this, and going behind the counter, reached down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over-against her:</p>
            <pb n="39" xml:id="pb-39" facs="#i69"/>
            <p>they were all too large. The beautiful Griffet measured them one by one across my hand - It would not alter the dimensions - She begged I would try a single pair, which seemed to be least - She held it open - my hand slipped into it at once - It will not do, said I, shaking my head a little - No, said she, doing the same thing.</p> <p>There are certain combined looks of simple subtlety - where whim, and sense, and seriousness, and nonsense are so blended, that all the languages of Babel set loose together could not express them - they are communicated and caught so instantaneously, that you can scarce say which party is the infector. I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about it - it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would not do; so folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counter - it was narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lie between us.</p> <p>The beautiful Griffet looked sometimes at the gloves, then sideways to the window, then at the gloves - and then at me. I was not disposed to break silence - I followed her example. So I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her - and so on alternately.</p> <p>I found I lost considerably in every attack - she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eye-lashes with such penetration, that she looked into my very heart and reins - It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did - </p>
            <pb n="40" xml:id="pb-40" facs="#i70"/>
            <p>It is no matter, said I, taking up a couple of the pair next me, and putting them into my pocket.</p> <p>I was sensible the beautiful Griffet had not ask'd above a single livre above the price - I wish'd she had had ask'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about - Do you think, my dear Sir, said she, mistaking my embarrassment, that I could ask a sous too much of a stranger - and of a stranger whose politeness, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honor to lay himself at my mercy? - M'en croyez capable? - Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are welcome - So counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeeper's wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.</p> <p>SENT.

            <pb n="41" xml:id="pb-41" facs="#i71"/>
            <p>story: he had seen the croix, set in gold, with its red ribband, he said, tied to his button-hole - and had looked into his basket, and seen the pÃ¢tÃ©s which the Chevalier was selling; so could not be mistaken in that.</p> <p>Such a reverse in man's life awakens a better principle than curiosity: I could not help looking for some time at him as I sat in the remise - the more I looked at him, his croiz, and his basket, the stronger they wove themselves into my brain - I got out of the remise, and went towards him.</p> <p>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a sort of a bib which went half way up his breast; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His basket of little pÃ¢tÃ©s was covered over with a white damask napkin; another of the same kind was spread at the bottom; and there was a look of propretÃ© and neatness throughout; that one might have bought his pÃ¢tÃ©s of him, as much from appetite as sentiment.</p> <p>He made an offer of them to neither; but stood still with them at the corner of an hotel, for those to buy who chose it, without solicitation.</p> <p>He was about forty-eight - of a sedate look, something approaching to gravity. I did not wonder. - I went up rather to the basket than him, and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his patÃ©s into my hand - I begged he would explain his appearance which affected me.</p>
            <pb n="42" xml:id="pb-42" facs="#i72"/>
            <p>He told me in a few words, that the best part of his life had passed in the service, in which, after spending a small patrimony, he had obtained a company and the croix with it; but that, at the conclusion of the last peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with those of some other regiments, left without any provision, - he found himself in a wide world without friends, without a livre - and indeed, said he, without any thing but this - (pointing, as he said it, to his croix): - the poor Chevalier won my pity, and he finished the scene with winning my esteem too.</p> <p>The King, he said, was the most generous of Princes; but his generosity could neither relieve nor reward every one, and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number. He had a little wife, he said, whom he loved, who did the pÃ¡tisserie; and added, he felt no dishonour in defending her and himself from want in this way - unless Providence had offered him a better.</p> <p>It would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good, in passing over what happened to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p> <p>IT seems, he usually took his stand towards the iron gates which lead up to the palace; and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers, numbers had made the same enquiry which I had done - He had told them the same story, and always with so much modesty and good sense, that it had reached at last</p>

The Marquis d'E**** had fought up against his condition with great firmness; wishing to preserve, and still shew to the world some little fragments of what his ancestors had been - their indiscretions had put it out of his power. There was enough left for the little exigencies of obscurity - But he had two boys who looked up to him for light - he thought they deserved it. He had tried his sword - it could not open the way - the mounting was too expensive - and simple oeconomy was not a match for it - there was no resource but commerce.</p>

            <p>In any other province in France, save Britanny, this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wished to see re-blossom - But in Britanny there being a provision for this, he availed himself of it; and taking an occasion when the States were assembled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two boys, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of duchy, which, tho' seldom claimed, he said, was no less in force, he took his sword from his side - Here, said he, take it; and be trusty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</p> <p>The President accepted the Marquis's sword - he staid a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his house, and departed.</p> <p>The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business, with some unlooked for bequests from distant branches of his house - returned home to reclaim his nobility, and to support it.</p> <p>It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a sentimental one, that I should be at Rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition - I call it solemn - it was so to me.</p> <p>The Marquise entered the court with his whole family: he supported his lady - his eldest son supported his sister, and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his mother - He put his handkerchief to his face twice - </p>

Come, Honesty! said I, - seeing it was impracticable to pass betwixt him and the gate - art thou for coming in, or going out?</p> <p>The ass twisted his head round to look up the street - </p> <p>Well - replied I - we'll wait a minute for thy driver.</p> <p> - He turned his head thoughtful about, and looked wistfully the opposite way - </p> <p>I understand thee perfectly, answered I - if thou takest a wrong Step in the affair he will cudgel thee to death - Well! a minute is but a minute, and if it saves a fellow creature a drubbing, it shall not be set down as ill spent. He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on, and the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unsavoriness, had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times, and picked it up again - God help thee, Jack! said I, thou hast a bitter breakfast on't - and many a bitter day's labor - and many a bitter blow, I fear, for its wages - 'tis all - all bitterness to thee, whatever life is to others.</p>

The word was but one half of it pronounced, when a person coming in, let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil's crupper, which put an end to the ceremony.

But from whence, replied my Father, have you concluded so soon, Doctor Slop, that the Writer is of our Church? - for aught I can see yet, - he may be of any Church - Because, answered Doctor Slop, if he was of ours, - he durst no more take such a license, - than a bear by  his beard; - If in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle, - a saint, - or even the paring of a saint's nail, - he would have</p>

            <p>his eyes scratched out. - What, by the saint? quoth my uncle Toby. No, replied Doctor Slop, he would have an old house over his head. Pray, is the Inquisition an ancient building, answered my uncle Toby. or is it a modern one? - I know nothing of Architecture, replied Doctor Slop. - An't please your honors, quoth Trim, the Inquisition is the vilest - Prithee spare thy Description, Trim, I hate the very name of it, said my father. - No matter for that, answered Doctor Slop, - it has its uses; for that, answered Doctor Slop, - it has its uses; for though I'm no great Advocate for it, yet, in such a case as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains. God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby. Amen, added Trim; for Heaven above knows, I have a poor Brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it - I never heard one word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily: How came he there, Trim? - O, Sir! the Story will make your Heart bleed, - as it has made mine a thousand times; - the short of the story is this; - That my brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon - and married a Jew's widow, who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which, some how or other, was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he was lying with his wife and two small Children, and carried directly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued Trim, fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart, - the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour; he</p>

            <p>was as honest a soul, added Trim, (pulling out his handkerchief) as ever blood warmed. - </p> <p> - The Tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away, - A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes. - Certain proof of pity! Come, Trim, quoth my father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a little vent, - read on, - and put this melancholy story out of thy head - I grieve that I interrupted thee: but prithee begin the Sermon again; - for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as thou sayest, I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the Apostle has given.</p> <p>Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his pocket, and, making a bow as he did it, - he began again.]</p> <p>THE</p> <p>ABUSES OF CONSCIENCE;</p> <p>A SERMON</p> <p>HEBREWS XIII, 18.</p> <p> - For we TRUST we have a good Conscience. - </p> <p>" - TRUST! trust we have a good Conscience! Surely, if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable</p>
            <pb n="52" xml:id="pb-52" facs="#i82"/>
            <p>evidence, it must be this very thing, - whether he has a good conscience or no."</p> <p>[I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. Slop.]</p> <p>"If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account; - he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires - he must remember his past pursuits, and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general, have governed the actions of his life." [I defy him, without an assistant, quoth Dr. Slop.]</p> <p>"In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and, as the wise man complains, hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth, and with labor do we find the things that are before us. But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself; - is conscious of the web she have wove; - knows its texture and fineness, and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her."</p> <p>[The language is good, and I declare Trim reads very well, quoth my father.]</p> <p>"Now, - as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this; and the judgment, either of approbation or censure, which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives; 'tis plain, you will say from the very terms of the proposition, - whenever this inward testimony goes against a man, and he stands self-accused, - that he must necessarily be a</p>
            <pb n="53" xml:id="pb-53" facs="#i83"/>
            <p>guilty man. - And, on the contrary, when the report is favorable on his side, and his heart condemns him not; - that it is not a matter of trust, as the Apostle intimates, but a matter of certainty and fact, that the conscience is good, and that the man must be good also."</p> <p>[Then the Apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose, quoth Dr. Slop, and the Protestant divine is in the right. Sir, have patience, replied my father; for I think it will presently appear that Saint Paul and the Protestant divine are both of an opinion. - As nearly so, quoth Dr. Slop, as east is to west; - but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes from the liberty of the press.</p> <p>It is not more, at the worst, replied my uncle Toby, than the liberty of the pulpit, for it does not appear that the sermon is printed, or ever likely to be.</p> <p>Go on, Trim, quoth my father]</p> <p>"At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case; and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man, - that did no such thing ever happen, as that the conscience of a man, by long habits of sun, might (as the scripture assures it may) insensibly become hard; - and like some tender parts of his body, by much stress and continual hard usage, lose, by degrees, that nice sense and perception with which God and nature endowed it: - Did this never happen; - or was it certain that self-love could never hang the least bias upon the judgment;</p>

            <p> - or that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions, and encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness: - Could no such thing as favour and affection enter this sacred COURT: - Did Wit disdain to take a bribe in it: - or was ashamed to show its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment: Or, lastly, were we assured that INTEREST stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing, - and that passion never got into the judgment seat, and pronounced sentence in the stead of reason, which is always supposed to preside and determine upon the case: - Was this truly so, as the objection must suppose; - no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed it: - and the guilt or innocence of every man's life could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the degrees of his own approbation and censure.</p> <p>I own, in one case, whenever a man's conscience does accuse him (as it seldom errs on that side) that he is guilty; and unless in melancholy and hypochondriac cases, we may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation.</p> <p>But the converse of the Proposition will not hold true; - namely, that whenever there is guilt, the conscience must accuse: and if it does not, that a man is therefore innocent. - This is not fact - So</p>
            <pb n="55" xml:id="pb-55" facs="#i85"/>
            <p>that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himself, - that he thanks God his mind does not misgive him; and that, consequently, he has a good conscience, because he has a quiet one, - is fallacious; - and as current as the inference is, and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts, - you see it liable to so much error from a false application; - the principle upon which it goes so often perverted; - the whole force of it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast away, that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life, which confirm the account.</p> <p>A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles; - exceptionable in his conduct to the world; shall live shameless, in the open commission of a sin, which no reason or pretence can justify, - a sin by which, contrary to all the workings of humanity, he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt; - rob her of her best dowry; and not only cover her own head with dishonor, - but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake. Surely, you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life; - he can have no rest night or day from its reproaches.</p> <p>Alas! CONSCIENCE had something else to do all this time, than break in upon him; as Elija</p>

Perhaps HE was going out in company with HONOR to fight a duel; to pay off some debt at play; - or dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust: Perhaps CONSCIENCE all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud against petty larceny, and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing; so that he lives as merrily," - [If he was of our church, though, quoth Dr. Slop, he could not] - "sleeps as soundly in his bed; and at last meets death as unconcernedly, - perhaps much more so, than a much better man."</p> <p>[All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my father, - the case could not happen in our church - It happens in ours, however, replied my father, but too often. - I own, quoth Dr. Slop, (struck a little with my father's frank acknowledgment) that a man in the Romish church may live as badly; - but then he cannot easily die so. - 'Tis little matter, replied my father, with an air of indifference, - how a rascal dies. - I mean, answered Dr. Slop, he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments. - Pray how many have you in all? said my uncle Toby, - for I always forget. - Seven, answered Dr. Slop. - Humph! - said my uncle Toby; tho' not accented as a note of acquiescence, - but as an interjection</p>

            <p>of that particular species of surprise, when a man in looking into a drawer finds moer of a thing than he expected. - Humph! replied my uncle Toby. Dr. Slop, who had an ear, understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments. - Humph! replied Dr. Slop (stating my uncle Toby's argument over again to him) - Why, Sir, are there not seven cardinal virtues? - Seven mortal sins) - Seven golden candle-sticks? - Seven heavens? - 'Tis more than I know, replied my uncle Toby. - Are there not seven wonders of the world? - Seven days of the creation? - Seven planets? - Seven plagues? - That there are, quoth my father, with a most affected gravity. But prithee, continued he, go on with the rest of thy characters, Trim.]</p> <p>"Another is sordid, unmerciful," (here Trim waved his right hand) "a strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable either of private friendship, or public spirit. Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress, and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer." [An't please you honours, cried Trim, I think this a viler man than the other.]</p> <p>"Shall not Conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions? - No; thank God, there is no occasion. I pay every man his own; - I have no fornication to answer to my conscience; - no faithless vows or promises to make up; - I have debauched no man's wife or child; thank God, I am not as other</p>

            <p>men, adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who stands before me. A third is crafty and designing in his nature. View his whole life, - 'tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges, basely to defeat the true intent of all laws, - plain-dealing, and the safe enjoyment of our several properties. - You will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man: - shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth, or the unsuspecting temper of his friend, who would have trusted him with his life. When old age comes on, and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account, and state it over again with his conscience - CONSCIENCE looks into the STATUTES at LARGE; - finds no express law broken by what he has done; - perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurred; - sees no scourge waving over his head, or prison opening his gates upon him: - What is there to affright his conscience? - Conscience has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law, sits there invulnerable, fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides; - that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold."</p> <p>[The character of this last man, said Dr. Slop, interrupting Trim, is more detestable than all the rest; - and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst you: - amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded,</p>

            <p> - three times in a year, at least, he must go to confession. Will that restore it to sight? quoth my uncle Toby. - Go on, Trim, quoth my father. 'Tis very short, replied Trim. - I wish it was longer, quoth my uncle Toby, for I like it hugely. - Trim went on.]</p> <p>"A forth man shall want even this refuge; shall break through all the ceremony of slow chicane; - scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose: - See the bare-faced villain, how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs, murders! - Horrid! - But indeed much better was not to be expected, in the present case - the poor man was in the dark! - his Priest had got the keeping of his conscience; - and all he would let him know of it, was, That he must believe in the Pope; - go to Mass; - cross himself; - tell his beads; - be a good Catholic; and that this, in all conscience, was enough to carry him to Heaven. What; - if he perjures! - Why; - he had a mental reservation in it. - But if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him; - if he robs, - if he stabs, will not conscience, on every such act, receive a wound itself? - Aye, but the man has carried it to a confession; - the wound digests there, and will do well enough, and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution. O Popery! what hast thou to answer for? - When, not content with the too many natural and fatal way, through which the heart of</p>

            <p>man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all things; - thou hast wilfully set open the wife gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller, too apt, God knows, to go astray of himself; and confidently speak to himself, when there is no peace.</p> <p>Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence. If any man doubts the reality of them, or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself, - I must refer him a moment to his own reflections, and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart.</p> <p>Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation, numbers of wicked actions stand there, tho' equally bad and vicious in their own natures; - he will soon find, that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties, which a soft and a flattering hand can give them; - and that the others, to which he feels no propensity, appear, at once, naked and deformed, surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonor.</p> <p>When David surprised Saul sleeping in the cave, and cut off the skirt of his robe - we read his heart smote him for what he had done: - But in the matter of Uriah, where a faithful and gallant servant, whom he ought to have loved and honored, fell to make way for his lust, - where conscience</p>
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i91"/>
            <p>had so much greater reason to take the alarm, his heart smote him not. A whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime, to the time Nathan was sent to reprove him; and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified, during all that time, for what he had done.</p> <p>Thus conscience, this once able monitor, - placed on high as a judge within us, and intended by our Maker as a just and equitable one too, - by an unhappy train of causes and impediments, takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes, - does its office so negligently, sometimes so corruptly, - that it is not to be trusted alone; and therefore we find there is a necessity, an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations.</p> <p>So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in, - namely, in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man, an useful citizen, a faithful subject to your king, or a good servant to your God, - call in religion and morality. - Look, what is written in the law of God? - How readest thou? - Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth; - what say they?</p> <p>Let CONSCIENCE determine the matter upon these reports; - and then if thy heart condemns thee not, which is the case the Apostle supposes, - </p>

            <p>the rule will be infallible," - [Here Dr. Slop fell asleep] - "thou wilt have confidence towards God; - that is, have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast passed upon thyself, is the judgment of God; - and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence, which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions.</p> <p>Blessed is the man, indeed, than, as the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins: Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him; whether he be rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good heart (a heart thus guided and informed) he shall at all times rejoice in a cheerful countenance; his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high. - [A tower has no strength, quoth my uncle Toby, unless 'tis flank'd.]</p> <p> - In the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists, and give the state he lives in, a better security for his behaviour than all the clauses and restrictions put together, which law-makers are forced to multiply: - Forced, I say, as things stand; human laws not being a matter of original choice, but of pure necessity, brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves; well intending, by the many provisions made, that in all such corrupt and misguided cases, where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us up-right,</p>

            <p> - to supply their force, and, by the terrors of gaols and halters, oblige us to it.</p> <p>[I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Temple, - or at some Assize. - I like the reasoning, and am sorry that Dr. Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction: - for it is now clear, that the Parson, as I thought at first, never insulted St. Paul in the least; - nor has there been, brother, the least difference between them. A great matter, if they had differed, replied my uncle Toby, - the best friends in the world may differ sometimes. - True, - brother Toby, quoth my father, shaking hands with him - we'll fill out pipes, brother, and then Trim shall go on. - </p> <p>He read on as follows.]</p> <p>To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong: - The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion; - the second, those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together, that you cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination, (though the attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually destroying them both.</p> <p>I said the attempt is often made; and so it is; - there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion, and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the bitterest affront, shou'd you</p>
            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i94"/>
            <p>but hint at a suspicion of his moral character, or - imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite.</p> <p>When there is some appearance that it is so, - tho; one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were we to look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honor of his motive.</p> <p>Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest, his pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependance upon his actions in matters of great distress.</p> <p>I will illustrate this by an example.</p> <p>I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call in," - </p> <p>[There is no need, cried Dr. Slop, (waking) to call in any physician in this case]</p> <p> - To be neither of them men of much religion; I hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions, with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt. Well; - notwithstanding this, I put my fortune into the hands of the ones; - and what is dearer still to me, I trust my life to the honest skill of the other.</p> <p>Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence. Why, in the first place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ</p>
            <pb n="65" xml:id="pb-65" facs="#i95"/>
            <p>the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage; - I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life: - I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters. In a word, I am persuaded that they cannot hurt me, without hurting themselves more.</p> <p>But put it otherwise, namely, that interest lay, for once, on the other side: that a case should happen wherein the one, without stain to his reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me naked in the world; - or that the other could send me out of it, and enjoy an estate by my death, without dishonor to himself or his art: - In this case, what hold have I of either of them? - Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the question; - Interest, the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against me: - What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation? - Alas! I have nothing, - but what is lighter than a bubble - I must lie at the mercy of HONOR, or some such capricious principle - Strait security for two of the most valuable blessings! - my property, and myself.</p> <p>As, therefore, we can have no dependance upon morality without religion; - so, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality, nevertheless, 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of himself, in the light of a religious man.</p>

            <p>He shall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable, - but even wanting in points of common honesty; yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age, - is zealous for some points of religion, - goes twice a-day to church, - attends the sacraments, - and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion, - shall cheat his conscience into a judgment, that for this he is a religious man, and has discharged truly his duty to God: And you will find that such a man, through force of this delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affection of piety, - though, perhaps, ten times more real honesty than himself.</p> <p>This likewise is a sore evil under the sun: and, I believe, there is no one mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious mischiefs.</p> <p> - For a general proof of this, - examine the history of the Romish church:" - </p> <p>[Well, what can you make of that? cried Dr. Slop.] - "see what scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed," - [They may thank their own obstinacy, cried Dr. Slop] - "have all been sanctified by religion not strictly governed by morality.</p> <p>In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided Saint-errant, spared neither age, or merit, or sex, or condition? - and, as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity, he</p>

Hark! - hark! what a piteous groan!" - [Here the tears began to trickle down] - "just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial, and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent! - [D-n them all, quoth Trim, his color returning into his face as read as blood.] - "Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors, - his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement." - [Oh! 'tis my brother, cried poor Trim in a most passionate exclamation, dropping the sermon upon the ground, and clapping his hands together - I fear 'tis poor Tom. My father's and my uncle Toby's hearts yearned with sympathy for the poor fellow's distress; even Slop himself acknowledged pity for him. - Why, Trim, said my father, this is not a history, - 'tis a sermon thou art reading; prithee begin the sentence again.] - "Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors, - his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement, you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers.</p> <p>Observe the last movement of that horrid engine!" - [I would rather face a cannon, quoth Trim,</p>

            <p>"See him dragged out of it again to meet the flames, and the insults in his last agonies, which this principle, - this principle, that there can be religion without mercy, has prepared for him. The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is, to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare them with the spirit of christianity; - 'tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us, for these and such like cases, and it is worth a thousand arguments - By their fruits ye shall know them.</p> <p>I will add no farther to the length of this sermon, than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from it.</p> <p>First, Whenever a man talks loudly against religion, always suspect that it is not his reason, but his passions, which have got the better of his CREED. A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbours, and where they separate, depend upon it, 'tis for no other cause but quietness sake.</p> <p>Secondly, When a man thus represented, tells you in any particular instance, - That such a thing goes against his conscience, - always believe he means exactly the same thing, as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach; - a present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both.</p> <p>In a word, - trust that man in nothing, who has not a CONSCIENCE in every thing.</p>

            <p>And, in your own case, remember this plain distinction, a mistake in which has ruined thousands, - that your conscience is not a law: - No, God and reason made the law, and have placed conscience within you to determine, - not like a Asiatic Cadi, according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions, - but like a British Judge, in this land of liberty and good sense, who makes no new law, but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written."</p> <p>END OF THE SERMON.</p> <p>T. SHANDY, V. 1. C. 40.</p> <p>REMAINDER OF THE</p> <p>STORY OF TRIM'S BROTHER.</p> <p>AS Tom's place, an't please your honor, was easy - and the weather warm - it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a Jew who kept a sausage-shop in the same street, had the ill luck to die of a strangury, and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade - Tom thought (as every body in Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to the widow, except that of buying a pound of sausages</p>
            <pb n="72" xml:id="pb-72" facs="#i102"/>
            <p>at her shop - Tom set out - counting the matter thus within himself, as he walked along, that let the worst come of it that could, he should at least get a pound of sausages for their worth - but, if things went well, he should be set up; inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of sausages - but a wife - and a sausage shop, an't please your honor, into the bargain.</p> <p>Every servant in the family, from high to low, wished Tom success; and I can fancy, an't please your honor, I see him this moment, with his white dimity waistcoat and breeches, and hat a little o'one side, passing jollily along the street, swinging his stick, with a smile and a cheerful word for every body he met.</p> <p>But, alas! Tom! thou smilest no more, cried the Corporal, looking on one side of him upon the ground, as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon.</p> <p>Poor fellow! said my uncle Toby, feeling.</p> <p>He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an't please your honor, as ever blood warm'd - </p> <p>Then he resembled thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby, rapidly.</p> <p>The Coporal blushed down to his fingers ends - A tear of sentimental bashfulness - another of gratitude to my uncle Toby - and a tear of sorrow for his brother's misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly down his cheek together: my uncle Toby's kindled as one lamp does at another; and taking hold of the breast of Trim's coat (which had been that of Le Fevre's), as if to ease his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer feeling - he stood silent for a minute and a half; at</p>

            <p>the end of which he took his hand away; and the Corporal making a bow, went on with his story of his brother and the Jew's widow.</p> <p>When Tom, an't please your honor, got to the shop, there was nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end of a long cane, flapping away flies - not killing them.</p> <p>'Tis a pretty picture, said my uncle Toby, - she had suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt mercy - </p> <p> - She was good, an't please your honor, from nature, as well as from hardships: and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless slut, that would melt a heart of stone, said Trim; and some dismal winter's evening, when your honor is in the humour, they shall be told you with the rest of Tom's story, for it makes a part of it.</p> <p>Then do not forget, Trim, said my uncle Toby.</p> <p>A negro has a soul? an't please your honor, said the Corporal, (doubtingly.)</p> <p>I am not much versed, Corporal, quoth my uncle Toby, in things of that kind; but I suppose, God would not leave him without one, any more than thee or me.</p> <p>It would be putting one sadly over the head of another, quoth the Corporal.</p> <p>It would be so, said my uncle Toby.</p> <p>Why then, an't please your honor, is a black wench to be used worse than a white one?</p> <p>I can give no reason, said my uncle Toby - </p>
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i104"/>
            <p> - Only, cried the Corporal, shaking his head, because she has no one to stand up for her - </p> <p>'Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, - which recommends her to protection, and her brethren with her; 'tis the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands now - where it may be here-after, heaven knows! - but be it where it will, the brave, Trim, will not use it unkindly.</p> <p> - God forbid, said the Corporal.</p> <p>Amen, responded my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon his heart.</p> <p>The Corporal returned to his story, and went on - but with an embarrassment in doing it, which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to comprehend; for by the many sudden transitions all along, from one kind and cordial passion to another, in getting thus far on his way, he had lost the sportable key of his voice, which gave sense and spirit to his tale: he attempted twice to resume it, but could not please himself; so giving a stout hem! to rally back the retreating spirits, and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm a-kimbo on one side, and with his right a little extended, supported her on the other - the Corporal got as near the note as he could; and in that attitude, continued his story.</p> <p>As Tom, an't please your honor, had no business at that time with the Moorish girl, he passed on into the room beyond, to talk to the Jew's widow about love - and being, as I have told your honor, an open, cheary-hearted lad, with his character wrote in his</p>

SHANDY, V. IV. C. 64.</p> <p>THE BEGUINE.</p> <p>I Must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle Toby's, who went by the name of Trim, had been a Corporal in my uncle's own company, - his real name was James Butler, - but having got the nick-name of Trim in the regiment, my uncle Toby, unless when he happened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any other name.</p> <p>The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his  left knee by a musket bullet, at the battle of Landen, which was two years before the affair of Namur; - and as the fellow was well-beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle Toby took him for his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle Toby in the</p>
            <pb n="76" xml:id="pb-76" facs="#i106"/>
            <p>camp an in his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster, and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection.</p> <p>My uncle Toby loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him still, was the similitude of their knowledge. - For Corporal Trim, (for so, for the future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his master's plans, &amp;c. exclusive and besides what he gained HOBBY-HORSICALLY, as a body servant, Non Hobby Horsical per se; - had become no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook and chamber-maid, to know as much of the nature of strong-holds as my uncle Toby himself.</p> <p>I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trim's character, - and it is the only dark line in it. - The fellow loved to advise, - or rather to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-going, - you had no hold of him - he was voluable; - the eternal interlardings of your Honor, with the respectfulness of Corporal Trim's manner, interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution, - that though you might have been incommoded, - you could not well be angry. My uncle Toby, was seldom either the one or the other with him, - or, at least, this fault, in Trim, broke no squares with them. My uncle Toby,</p>
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i107"/>
            <p>as I said, loved the man; - and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant, - but as an humble friend, - he could not bear to stop his mouth. - Such was Corporal Trim.</p> <p>So, thou wast once in love, Trim! said my uncle Toby, smiling - </p> <p>Souse! replied the Corporal - over head and ears! an't please your honor. Prithee when? where? - and how came it to pass? - I never heard one word of it before, quoth my uncle Toby. - I dare say, answered Trim, that every drummer and serjeant's son in the regiment knew of it - It's high time I should - said my uncle Toby.</p> <p>Your honor remembers with concern, said the Corporal, the total rout and confusion of our camp, and the army, at the affair of Landen; every one was left to shift for himself; and if it had not been for the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley and Galway, which covered the retreat over the bridge of Neerspeeken, the *King himself could scarce have gained it - he was pressed hard, as your honor knows, on every side of him - </p> <p>Gallant mortal! cried my uncle Toby, caught up with enthusiasm - this moment, now that all is lost, I see him galloping across me, Corporal, to the left, to bring up the remains of the English horse along with him, to support the right, and tear the laurel from Luxembourg's brows, if yet 'tis possible - I see</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* King William.</p>

            <p>him with the knot of his scarf, just shot off, insusing fresh spirits into poor Galway's regiment - riding along the line - then wheeling about, and charging Conti at the head of it - Brave! brave, by heaven! cried my uncle Toby, he deserves a crown - as richly as a thief a halter, shouted Trim.</p> <p>My uncle Toby knew the Corporal's loyalty; - otherwise the comparison was not at all to his mind - it did not altogether strike the Corporal's fancy when he had made it - but it could not be recalled - so he had nothing to so, but proceed.</p> <p>As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to think of any thing, but his own safety - Though Talmash, said my uncle Toby, brought off the foot with great prudence - But I was left upon the field, said the Corporal. Thou wast so, poor fellow! replied my uncle Toby - So that it was noon the next day, continued the Corporal, before I was exchanged, and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more, in order to be conveyed to our hospital. - The anguish of my knee, continued the Corporal, was excessive in itself; and the uneasiness of the cart, with the roughness of the roads which were terribly cut up - making bad still worse - every step was death to me: so that with the loss of blood, and the want of care-taking of me, and a fever I felt coming on besides - (Poor soul! said my uncle Toby) all together, an't please your honor, was more than I could sustain.</p> <p>I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant's house, where our cart, which was the last</p>
            <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i109"/>
            <p>of the line, had halted; they had helped me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropped it upon some sugar, and seeing it had cheer'd me, she had given it me a second and a third time. - So I was telling her, an't please your honor, the anguish I was in, and was saying it was so intolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the room - and die, than go on - when, upon her attempting to lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was a good soul! as your honor, said the Corporal, wiping his eyes, will hear.</p> <p>I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle Toby.</p> <p>'Tis the most serious thing, an't please your honor (sometimes) that is in the world.</p> <p>By the persuasion of the young woman, continued the Corporal, the cart with the wounded men set off without me: she had assured them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart. So when I came to myself - I found myself in a still, quiet cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the peasant and his wife. I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room, with my wounded leg upon the chair, and the young woman beside me, holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my nose with one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other.</p> <p>I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant;</p>
            <pb n="80" xml:id="pb-80" facs="#i110"/>
            <p>(for it was no inn) - so had offered her a little purse with eighteen florins, which my poor brother Tom (here Trim wip'd his eyes) had sent me as a token, by a recruit, just before he set out for Lisbon. - </p> <p>The young woman called the old man and his wife into the room, to show them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed, and what little necessaries I should want, till I should be in a condition to be got to the hospital - Come them! said she, tying up the little purse, - I'll be your banker - but as that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nurse too.</p> <p>I thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her dress, which I then began to consider more attentively -t hat the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant. She was in black down to her toes, with her hair concealed under a cambric border, laid close to her forehead: she was one of those kind of Nuns, an't please your honor, of which your honor knows there are a great many in Flanders, which they let loose - By the description, Trim, said my uncle Toby, I dare say she was a young Beguine, of which there are none to be found any where but in the Spanish Netherlands - except at Amsterdam - they differ from Nuns in this, that they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry; they visit and take care of the sick by profession - I had rather, for my own part, they did it out of good-nature.</p> <p>The young Beguine, continued the Corporal, had scarce given herself time to tell me "she would be</p>
            <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i111"/>
            <p>my nurse," when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one, and prepare something for me - and in a short time - though I thought it a long one - she came back with flannels, &amp;c. &amp;c. and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours, and made me a thin bason of gruel for my supper - she wished me rest, and promised to be with me early in the morning - She wish'd me, an't please your  honor, what was not to be had. My fever ran very high that night - her figure made sad disturbance within me - I was every moment cutting the world in tow - to give her half of it - and every moment was I crying, that I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her - The whole night long was the fair Beguine, like an angel, close by my bed-side, holding back my curtain and offering me cordials - and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promised, and giving them in reality. In truth she was scarce ever from me; and so accustomed was I to receive life from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost color when she left the room. - Love, an't please your honor, is exactly like war, in this; that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks complete o' Saturday night - may nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morning - IT happened so here, an't please your honor, with this difference only - that it was on Sunday in the afternoon, when I fell in love all at once with a sisserara - it burst upon me, an't please your honor, like a bomb - scarce giving me time to say, "God bless me."</p>
            <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i112"/>
            <p>I thought, Trim, said my uncle Toby, a man never fell in love so very suddenly.</p> <p>Yes, an't please your honor, if he is in the way of it - replied Trim.</p> <p>I prithee, quoth my uncle Toby, inform me how this matter happened.</p> <p> - With all pleasure, said the Corporal, making a bow. I had escaped, continued the Corporal, all that time from falling in love, and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined otherwise - there is no resisting our fate. It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honor. The old man and his wife had walked out - Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house. - </p> <p>There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard; when the fair Beguine came to see me.</p> <p>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well - the inflammation had been gone off for some time; but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee, so insufferable, that I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it. Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it - it only wants rubbing a little, said the Beguine; so covering it with the bed-clothes, she began with the fore-finger of her right hand to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing.</p>
            <pb n="83" xml:id="pb-83" facs="#i113"/>
            <p>In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second finger - and presently it was laid flat with the other; and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while: it then came into my head that I should fall in love - I blushed when I saw how white a hand she had - I shall never, an't please your honor, behold another hand so white whilst I live. - </p> <p>The young Beguine, continued the Corporal, perceiving it was of great service to me - from rubbing, for some time, with two fingers - proceeded to rub at length with three - till by little and little she brought down the fourth, and then rubbed with her whole hand: I will never say another word, an't please your honor, upon hands again - but it was softer than sattin.</p> <p>Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou wilt, said my uncle Toby; I shall hear thy story with the more delight - The Corporal thanked his master most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the Beguine's hand but the same thing over again - he proceeded to the effects of it.</p> <p>The fair Beguine, said the Corporal, continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee - till I feared her zeal would weary her - "I would do a thousand times more," said she, "for the love of Christ." As she continued rubbing - I felt it spread from under her hand, an't please your honor, to every part of my frame. - </p>
            <pb n="84" xml:id="pb-84" facs="#i114"/>
            <p>The more she rubbed, and the longer strokes she took - the more the fire kindled in my veins - till at length, by two or three strokes longer than the rest - my passion rose to the highest pitch - I seized her hand - and then thou clapped'st it to thy lips, Trim, said my uncle Toby - and madest a speech.</p> <p>Whether the Corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle Toby described it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in it the essence of all the love-romances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world.</p> <p>T.

            <p> - De gustibus non est disputandum; <note>Latin</note> - that is, there is no disputing against HOBBY-HORSES; and for my part, I seldom do; nor could I with any sort of grace, had I been an enemy to them at the bottom; for happening, at certain intervals and changes of the moon, to be both fiddler and painter, according as the fly stings: - Be it known to you, that I keep a couple of pads myself, upon which, in their turns, (nor do I care who knows it) I frequently ride out and take the air; though sometimes, to my shame be it spoken, I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think altogether right. - But the truth is, - I am not a wise man; - and beside am a mortal of so little consequence in the world, it is not much matter what I do: so I seldom fret or fume at all about it: nor does it much disturb my rest, when I see such great Lords and tall personages as hereafter follow; - such, for instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and so on, all of a row, mounted upon their several horses; - some with large stirrups, getting on in a more grave and sober pace; - others, on the contrary, tucked up to their very chins, with whips across their mouths, scouring and scampering it away like so many little party-colored devils astride a mortgage, - and as if some of them were resolved to break their necks. - So much the better - say I to myself; for in case the worst should happen, the world may make a shift to do excellently well without them; and for the rest, - why - God speed them - e'en let them ride on</p>

            <p>without opposition from me; for were their Lordships unhorsed this very night - 'tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before to-morrow morning.</p> <p>Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest. - But there is an instance, which I own puts me off my guard, and that is, when I see one born for great actions, and what is still more for his honor, whose nature ever inclines him to good ones; when I behold such a one, my Lord, like yourself, whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as his blood, and whom, for that reason, a corrupt world cannot spare one moment; - when I see such a one, my Lord, mounted, though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed to him, and my zeal for his glory wishes, - then, my Lord, I cease to be a philosopher, and in the first transport of an honest impatience, I wish the HOBBY-HORSE, with all his fraternity, at the Devil.</p> <p>T.

            <p>MARIA.</p> <p> - THEY were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I instantly let down the fore-glass to hear them more distinctly - 'Tis Maria, said the postillion, observing I was listening - Poor Maria, continued he, (leaning his body on one side to let me see her, for he was in a line betwixt us,) is sitting upon a bank, playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside her.</p> <p>The young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow, I would give him a four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to Moulines.</p> <p>And who is poor Maria? said I.</p> <p>The love and pity of all the villages around us, said the postillion - it is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and better fate did Maria deserve, than to have her banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the parish, who published them - </p> <p>He was going on, when Maria, who had made a short pause, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again - they were the same notes; - yet were ten times sweeter: it is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young man - but who has taught her to play it - or how she came by her pipe, no one knows: we think that heaven has assisted her in both; for</p>

            <p>ever since she has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation - she has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that service upon it almost night and day.</p> <p>The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition, and should have sifted out his history, had not poor Maria's taken such full possession of me.</p> <p>We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting; she was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tresses, drawn up into a silk net, with a few olive leaves, twisted a little fantastically on one side - she was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her.</p> <p> - God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses, said the postillion, have been said the several parish churches and convents around, for her; - but without effect; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the Virgin will at last restore her to herself; but her parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost for ever.</p> <p>As the postillion spoke this, Maria made a cadence so melancholy, so tender and querelous, that I sprang out of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.</p>

            <p>Maria looked wistfully for some time at me, and then at her goat - and then at me - and then at her goat again, and so on, alternately - </p> <p> - Well, Maria, said I, softly - What resemblance do you find?</p> <p>I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest conviction of what a beast man is, - that I asked the question; and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais scattered - and yet I own my heart smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that I swore I would set up for Wisdom, and utter grave sentences the rest of my days - and never - never attempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to live.</p> <p>As for writing nonsense to them - I believe, there was a reserve - but that I leave to the world.</p> <p>Adieu, Maria! - adieu, poor hapless damsel! some time, but not now, I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips - but I was deceived; for that moment she took her pipe, and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and with broken and irregular steps, walk'd softly to my chaise.</p> <p>T.

            <p>MARIA.</p> <p>MOULINES.</p> <p>I NEVER felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till now - to travel it through the Bourbonnois, the sweetest part of France - in the hey-day of the vintage, when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted up - a journey through each step of which, Music beats time to Labor, and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clusters - to pass through this with my affections flying out, and kindling at every group before me - and every one of them was pregnant with adventures.</p> <p>Just heaven! - it would fill up twenty volumes - and alas! I have but a few small pages of this to croud it into - and half these must be taken up with the poor Maria my friend Mr. Shandy met with near Moulines.</p> <p>The story he had told of that disordered maid affected me not a little in the reading; but when I got within the neighbourhood where she lived, it returned so strong into my mind, that I could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road, to the village where her parents dwelt, to enquire after her.</p> <p>'Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance, in quest of melancholy adventures - </p>

            <p>but I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me, as when I am entangled in them.</p> <p>The old mother came to the door; her looks told me the story before she opened her mouth - She had lost her husband; he had died, she said, of anguish for the loss of Maria's senses, about a month before - She had feared at first, she added, that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little understanding was left - but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to herself - still she could not rest - her poor daughter, she said, crying, was wandering somewhere about the road - </p> <p>- Why does my pulse beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, whose heart seemed only to be tuned to joy, to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes, as the woman stood and told it? I beckoned to the postillion to turn back into the road - </p> <p>When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening of the road leading to a thicket, I discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplar - she was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one side within her hand; - a small brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p> <p>I bid the postillion go on with the chaise to Moulines, and La Fleur to bespeak my supper - and that I would walk after him.</p> <p>She was dressed in white, and much as my friend described her, except that her hair hung loose, which</p>

            <p>before was twisted within a silk net. - She had, supper-added likewise to her jacket, a pale-green ribband, which fell across her shoulder to the waist; at the end of which hung her pipe. - Her goat had been as faithless as her lover; and she had got a little dog in lieu of him, which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle: as I looked at her dog, she drew him towards her with the string - "Thou shalt not leave me, Sylvio," said she. I looked in Maria's eyes, and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat; for, as she uttered them, the tears trickled down her cheeks.</p> <p>I sat down close by her; and Maria let me wipe them away, as they fell, with my handkerchief. - I then steep'd it in my own - and then in her's - and then in mine - and then I wip'd her's again - and as I did it, I felt such undescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</p> <p>I am positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me to the contrary.</p> <p>When Maria had come a little to herself, I asked her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before? She said, she was unsettled much at that time, but remembered it upon two accounts - that, ill as she was, she saw the person pitied her; and next, that her goat had stolen his handkerchief, and she had beat him for the theft - she had washed</p>

As she told me this, she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it; she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril - on opening it, I saw an S mark'd in one of the corners.</p> <p>She had since that, she told me, strayed as far as Rome, and walk'd round St. Peter's once - and return'd back - that she found her way alone across the Appennines - had travelled over all Lombardy without money - and through the flinty roads of Savoy without shoes - how she had borne it, and how she had got supported, she could not tell - but God tempers the wind, said Maria, TO THE SHORN LAMB.</p> <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, said I; and waft thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and shelter thee: thou shouldst eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup - I would be kind to thy Sylvio - in all thy weaknesses and wanderings I would seek after thee, and bring thee back - when the sun went down, I would say my prayers; and when I had done, thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe, nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</p> <p>Nature melted within me, as I uttered this; and Maria observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steep'd too much already to be of use, would</p>

JOURNEY, PAGE 217.</p> <p>THE PARSON'S HORSE.</p> <p>BE it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an account, - the parson we have to do with had made himself a country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed against himself, his station, and his office; - and that was in never appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten all description of him, was full brother to Rosinante, as far as similitude congenial could make him; for he answered his description to hair-breadth in every thing, - except that I do not remember 'tis any where said, that Rosinante was broken winded; and that, moreover, Rosinante, as is the happiness of most Spanish horses, fat or lean, - was undoubtedly a horse at all points.</p> <p>I know very well that the HERO'S horse was a horse of chaste deportment, which may have given grounds</p>
            <pb n="96" xml:id="pb-96" facs="#i126"/>
            <p>for the contrary opinion: Bit it is as certain at the same time, that Rosinante's continency (as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian carriers) proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood. - And let me tell you, madam, there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world, in behalf of which you could not say more for your life.</p> <p>Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work, - I could not stifle this distinction in favor of Don Quixote's horse; - in all other points, the parson's horse, I say, was just such another, - for he was as lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as HUMILITY herself could have bestrode.</p> <p>In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was greatly in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this horse of his, - for he was master of a very handsome demi-peak'd saddle, quilted on the seat with green plush, garnished with a double row of silver headed studs, and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing altogether suitable, of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, terminating in a deep, black, silk fringe, poudrÃ© d'or, - all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at all points as it should be. - But not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these up behind his study door: - and, in lieu of them, had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such</p>
            <pb n="97" xml:id="pb-97" facs="#i127"/>
            <p>a saddle, as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.</p> <p>In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry, who lived around him, - you will easily comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. To speak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both old and young. - Labor stood still as he pass'd - the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well, - the spinning wheel forgot its round, - even chuck-farthing and shufle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was not of the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations, - to hear the groans of the serious, - and the laughter of the light-hearted; - all which he bore with excellent tranquillity. - His character was, - he loved a jest in his heart - and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule, he would say, he could not  be angry with others for seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: So that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humor, - instead of giving the true cause, - he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself; and as he never carried on single ounce of flesh upon his own bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast, - he would sometimes insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider deserved; -</p>

            <p>that they were, centaur-like, - both of a piece. At other times, and in other moods, when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit, - he would say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep himself in countenance, but in spirits.</p> <p>At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to one of the mettle; - for on such a one he could sit mechanically, and meditate as delightfully de vanitate mundi et fugÃ¢ faeculi, <note>Latin</note> as with the advantage of a death's-head before him; - that, in all other exercitations, he could spend his time, as he rode slowly along, - to as much account as in his study; - that he could draw up an argument in his sermon, - or a hole in his breeches, as steadily on the one as in the other; - that brisk trotting and slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements. - But that upon his steed - he could unite and reconcile every thing, - he could compose his sermon - he could compose his cough, - and, in case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep. - In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but the true cause, - and he with-held the true one, only out of a nicety of temper, because he thought it did honor to him.</p>

Thou giv'st a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains - he finds the lacerated lamb of another's flock - This moment I beheld him leaning with his head against his crook, with piteous inclination looking down upon it! - Oh! had I come one moment sooner! - it bleeds to death - his gentle heart bleeds with it - </p> <p>Peace to thee, generous swain!

            <p>THE SUPPER.</p> <p>A SHOE coming loose from the fore-foot of the thill-horse, at the beginning og the ascent of mount Taurira, the postillion dismounted, twisted the shoe off, and put it in his pocket: as the ascent was of five or six miles, and that horse our main dependance, I made a point of having the shoe fastened on again, as well as we could; but the postillion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaise-box, being of no great use without them, I submitted to go on.</p> <p>He had not mounted half a mile higher, when coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil lost a second shoe, and from off his other fore foot. I then got out of the chaise in good earnest; and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I prevailed upon the postillion to turn up to it. The look of the house, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, soon reconciled me to the disaster. It was a little farm-house surrounded with about twenty acres of vine-yard, about as much corn - and close to the house, on one side, was a potagerie of an acre and a an half full of every thing which could make plenty in a French peasant's house - and on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal to dress it.

His wife sung now and then a little to the tune - then intermitted - and joined her old man again, as their children and grand-children danced before them.</p> <p>It was not till the middle of the second dance, when, for some pauses in the movement wherein they all seem'd to look up, I fancied I could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollity. - In a word, I thought I beheld Religion mixing in the dance - but as I had never seen her so engaged, I should have look'd upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading</p>

Mon Dieu! said he, pressing his hands together - you never used me unkindly. - I should think, said the lady, he is not likely. I blush'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyse - Excuse me, Madam, replied I - I treated him most unkindly; and from no provocation. 'Tis impossible, said the lady - My God! cried the Monk with a warmth of asseveration which seem'd not to belong to him - the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zeal - the lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his, could give offence to any.</p>

            <p>I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it. - We remained silent, without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place, when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word. Whilst this lasted, the Monk rubbed his horn-box upon the sleeve of his tunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction - he made a low bow, and said, 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest - but be it as it would - he begg'd we might exchange boxes - in saying this he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me with the other: and having kiss'd it - with a stream of good-nature in his eyes, he put it into his bosom - and took his leave.</p> <p>I guard this box as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, 'till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill requited, and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest passions, he abandoned the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his convent as in himself.</p>

            <p>from all considerations of self: so that without any observable act of the will, we suffer with the unfortunate, and feel a weight upon our spirits we know not why, on seeing the most common instnaces of their distress. But where the spectacle is uncommonly tragical, and complicated with many circumstances of misery, the mind is then taken captive at once, and were it inclined to it, has no power to make resistance, but surrenders itself to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern. So that when one considers this friendly part of nature, without looking farther, one would think it impossible for man to look upon misery without finding himself in some measure attached to the interest of him who suffers it - I say, one would think it impossible - for there are some tempers - how shall I describe them? - formed either of such impenetrable matter, or wrought up by habitual selfishness to such an utter insensibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow-creatures, as if they were not partakers of the same nature, or had no lot or connection with the species.</p> <p>SERMON 111, P.43.</p> <p>THE MERCIFUL MAN.</p> <p>LOOK into the world - how often do you behold a sordid wretch, - whose strait heart is open to no man's affliction, taking shelter behind an appearance of piety, and putting on the garb of religion,</p>

P. 46.</p> <p>PITY.</p> <p>IN benevolent natures, the impulse to pity is so sudden, that, like instruments of music, which obey the touch - the objects which are fitted to excite such impressions, work so instantaneous an effect, that you would think the will was scarce concerned, and that the mind was altogether passive int he sympathy which her own goodness has excited. The truth is - the soul is generally in such cases so busily taken up, and wholly engrossed by the object of pity, that she does not attend to her own operations, or take leisure to examine the principles upon which she acts.</p> <p>SERMON 111.

P. 72.</p> <p>HOUSE OF MOURNING.</p> <p>LET us go into the house of mourning, made so by such afflictions as have been brought in, merely by the common cross accidents and disasters to which our condition is exposed, - where, perhaps, the aged parents sit broken-hearted, pierced to their souls with the folly and indiscretion of a thankless child - the child of their prayers, in whom all their hopes and expectations centered: - perhaps a more affecting scene - a virtuous family lying pinched with want, where the unfortunate support of it having long struggled with a train of misfortunes, and bravely fought up against them, - is now piteously borne down at the last - overwhelmed with a cruel blow which no forecast or frugality could have prevented. - O God! look upon his afflictions - Behold him distracted with many sorrows, surrounded with the tender pledges of his love, and the partner of his cares - without bread to give them, unable, from the remembrance of better days, to dig; - to beg, ashamed.</p>

            <p>When we enter into the house of mourning such as this - it is impossible to insult the unfortunate even with an improper look - Under whatever levity and dissipation of heart, such objects catch our eyes, - they catch likewise our attentions, collect and call home our scattered thoughts, and exercise them with wisdom. A transient scene of distress, such as is here sketched, how soon does it furnish materials to set the mind at work! how necessarily does it engage it to the consideration of the miseries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities to which the life of man is subject! By holding up such a glass before it, it forces the mind to see and reflect upon the vanity - the perishing condition, and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world. From reflections of this serious cast, how insensibly do the thoughts carry us farther! - and from considering what we are - what kind of world we live in, and what evils befall us in it, how naturally do they set us to look forwards at what possibly we shall be, - for what kind of world we are intended - what evils may befall us there - and what provision we should make against them here, whilst we have time and opportunity! If these lessons are so inseparable from the house of mourning here supposed - we shall find it a still more instructive school of wisdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wise man seems to confine it in the text, in which, by the house of mourning, I believe he means that particular scene of sorrow, where there is lamentation</p>

            <p>and morning for the dead. Turn in hither, I beseech you, for a moment. Behold a dead man ready to be carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow! Perhaps a more affecting spectacle, a kind and indulgent father of a numerous family, lies breathless - snatched away in the strength of his age - torn in an evil hour from his children and the bosom of a disconsolate wife! Behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears, with settled sorrow in their looks, going heavily along to the house of mourning, to perform the last melancholy office, which, when the debt of nature is paid, we are called upon to pay each other! If this sad occasion which leads him there, has not done it already, take notice to what a serious and devout frame of mind every man is reduced, the moment he enters this gate of affliction. The busy and fluttering spirits, which in the house of mirth were wont to transport him from one diverting object to another - see how they are fallen! how peaceably they are laid! In this gloomy mansion full of shades and uncomfortable damps to seize the soul - see, the light and easy heart, which never knew what it was to think before, how pensive it is now, how soft, how susceptible, how full of religious impressions, how deeply it is smitten with sense and with a love of virtue! Could we, in this crisis, whilst the empire of reason and religion lasts, and the heart is thus exercised with wisdom, and busied with heavenly contemplations - could we see it naked as it is - stripped of its passions, unspotted</p>

Without this end, sorrow, I own, has no use but to shorten a man's days - nor can gravity, with all its studied solemnity of look and carriage, serve any end but to make one half of the world merry, and impose upon the other.</p> <p>SERM. 11.

And heaven is my witness, brother Shandy, that the pleasure I have taken in these things, - and that infinite delight, in particular, which has attended my sieges in my bowling-green, has rose within me, and I hope in the Corporal too, from the consciousness we both had, that in carrying them on, we were answering the great end of our creation.</p> <p>T.

The mind sits terrified at the objects she has magnified herself, and blackened; reduce them to their proper size and hue, she overlooks them. - 'Tis true, said I, correcting the proposition - the Bastille is not an evil to be despised - but strip it of its towers - fill up the fosse - unbarricade the doors - call it simply a confinement, and suppose 'tis some tyrant of a distemper - and not of a man which holds you in it - the evil vanishes, and you bear the other half without complaint.</p> <p>I was interrupted in the hey-day of this soliloquy, with a voice which I took to be of a child which complained "it could not get out," - I looked up</p>

Upon looking nearer, I saw him pale and feverish: in thirty years the western breeze had not once fann'd his blood - he had seen no sun, no moon, in all that time - nor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his lattice: - his children - </p> <p> - But here my heart began to bleed - and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait.</p> <p>He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the farthest corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calendar of small sticks were laid at the head, notch'd all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed there - he had one of those little sticks in his hand, and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, then cast it down - shook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle</p>

Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about forty - Never mind, said; some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.</p> <p>I feel some little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards the poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size or strength to get on in the world. - I cannot bear to see one of them trod upon; and had scarce got seated beside an old French officer at the Opera Comique, ere the disgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in.</p> <p>At the end of the orchestra, and betwixt that and the first side-box, there is a small esplanade left, where, when the house is full, numbers of all ranks take sanctuary.

The dwarf suffered inexpressibly on both sides; but the thing which incommoded him most was a tall corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of seeing either the stage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards, by seeking for some little opening betwixt the German's arm and his body, trying first one side, then the other; but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imagined - the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reached up his hand to the German's sleeve, and told him his distress - The German turn'd his head back, look'd down upon him as Goliah did upon David - and unfeelingly resumed his posture.</p> <p>I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my Monk's little horn-box - And how would thy meek and courteous spirit, my dear Monk! so temper'd to bear and forbear! - how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul'd complaint!</p> <p>The old French officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apostrophe, took the liberty to ask me what was the matter - I told him the story in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</p>

            <p>CHARITY.</p> <p>WHEN all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn, unless you are a little sour'd by the adventure, there is always a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into your chaise, and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty, who surround you. Let no man say, "Let them go to the devil" - 'tis a cruel journey to send a few miserables, and they have had sufferings enow without it: I always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand; and I would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise; he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them - they will be registered elsewhere.</p> <p>For my own part, there is no man gives so little as I do; for few that I know have so little to give: but as this was the first public act of my charity in France, I took the more notice of it.</p> <p>A well-a-day! said I, I have but eight sous in the world, shewing them in my hand, and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em.</p> <p>A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on, instantly withdrew his claim, by retiring two steps out of the circle, and making a disqualifying bow, on his part.

A second, with a graver aspect, points out to the costly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected: - tells the enquirer that the object he is in search of inhabits there, - that happiness lives only in company with the great, in the midst of much pomp and outward state, that he will easily find her out by the coat of many colours she has on, and the great luxury and expence of equipage and furniture with which she always sits surrounded.</p> <p>The Miser blesses God! - wonders how any one would mislead and wilfully put him upon so wrong a</p>

            <p>YORICK'S DEATH A BROKEN HEART.</p> <p>THE Mortgager, and MortgagÃ©e differ the one from the other, not more in length of purse, than the Jester and JestÃ©e do, in that of memory. But in this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-fours; (which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more than some of the best of Homer's can pretend to); - namely, That the one raises a sum, and the other a laugh at your expence, and thinks no more about it. Interest, however, still runs on in both cases; - the periodical or accidental payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive; till, at length, in some evil hour, - pop comes the creditor upon each, and, by demanding principal upon the spot, together with full interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations.</p> <p>As the reader (for I hate your ifs) has a thorough knowledge of human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my HERO could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos. To speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding Eugenius's frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted through any malignancy, - but, on the contrary, from an honesty</p>

            <p>of mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross'd out in course.</p> <p>Eugenius would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension, - to the uttermost mite. To which Yorick, with his usual carelesness of heart, would as often answer with a pshaw! - and if the subject was started in the fields, - with a hop, skip, and a jump at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and a couple of arm-chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a tangent, - Eugenius would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat better put together.</p> <p>Trust me, dear Yorick, this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can extricate thee out of. - In these sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person laughed at, considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him in that light too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and allies, - and musters up with them the many recruits that will lift under him from a sense of common danger; - 'tis no extravagant arithmetick to say, that for every ten jokes - thou hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half</p>

To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy, CRUELTY and COWARDICE twin ruffians, hired and set on by MALICE in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakes: - The best of us, my dear lad, lie open there, - and trust me, - trust me, Yorick, when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved upon, that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, 'tis an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.</p>

            <p>Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more sobriety. - But, alas, too late! - a grand confederacy, with ***** and ***** at the head of it, was formed before the first prediction of it. - The whole plan of the attack, just as Eugenius had foreboded, was put in execution all at once, - with so little mercy on the side of the allies, - and so little mercy on the side of the allies, - and so little suspicion in Yorick, of what was carrying on against him- that when he thought, good easy man! full surely preferment was o' ripening, - they had smote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.</p> <p>Yorick, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of the war, - but more so, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on, - he threw down the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought, quite broken-hearted.</p> <p>What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion, was as follows:</p> <p>A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in with an intent to take his last sight and farewell of him. Upon his drawing Yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself, Yorick looked up in his face, took hold of his hand, - and after thanking</p>
            <pb n="159" xml:id="pb-159" facs="#i189"/>
            <p>him for the many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet hereafter, - he would thank him again and again, - he told him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever. I hope not, answered Eugenius, with tears trickling down his cheek, and with the tendersest tone that ever man spoke. - I hope not, Yorick, said he. - Yorick replied with a look up, and a gentle squeeze of Eugenius's hand, and that was all, - but it cut Eugenius to his heart. - Come, - come, Yorick, quoth Engenius, wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man within him, - my dear lad, be comforted, - let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants them; - who knows what resources are in store, and what the power of God may yet do for thee? - Yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and gently shook his head; - For my part, cried Eugenius, crying bitterly as he uttered the words, - I declare I know not, Yorick, how to part with thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added Eugenius, chearing up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop, and that I may live to see it. - I beseech thee, Eugenius, quoth Yorick, taking off his night-cap as well as he could with his left hand, - his right hand being still grasped close in that of Eugenius, - I beseech thee to take a view of my head. - I see nothing that ails it, replied Eugenius. Then alas! my friend, said Yorick, let me tell you, that 'tis so bruised and mis-shapened with the blows which ***** and *****, and some others</p>

Yorick followed Eugenius with his eyes, to the door, - he then closed them, - and never opened them more.</p> <p>He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of -, under a plain marble slab, which his friend Eugenius, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy.</p> <note>image - text in a box</note> <p>Alas, poor YORICK!</p> <p>Ten times a day has Yorick's ghost the consolation to hear the monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as denote a general</p>

SLOP AND OBADIAH MEETING.</p> <p>IMAGINE to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a Dr. Slop, of about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a susquipedality of belly, which might have done honor to a serjeant in the horse-guards.</p> <p>Such were the outlines of Dr. Slop's figure, which - if you have read Hogarth's analysis of beauty, (and if you have not, I wish you would); - you must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to the mind by three strokes as three hundred.</p> <p>Imagine such a one, - for such, I say, were the outlines of Dr. Slop's figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling through the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty color - but of strength, - alack! scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such a fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition. - They were not. - Imagine to yourself, Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable speed the adverse way.</p>
            <pb n="166" xml:id="pb-166" facs="#i196"/>
            <p>Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.</p> <p>Had Dr. Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane directly towards him, at that monstrous rate, - splashing and plunging like a devil through thick and thin, as he approached, would not such a phaenomenon, with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it, round its axis, - have been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr. Slop in his situation, than the worst of Whiston's comets? - To say nothing of the NUCLEUS; that is, of Obadiah and the coach-horse. - In my idea, the vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the doctor's pony, quite away with it. What then do you think must hte terror and hydrophobia of Dr. Slop have been, when you read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along towards Shandy Hall, and had approached to within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle of the garden wall, - and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane, - when Obadiah and his coach-horse turned the corner, rapid, furious, - pop, - full upon him! - Nothing, I think in nature, can be supposed more terrible than such a rencounter, - so imprompt! so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr. Slop was!</p> <p>What could Dr. Slop do? - he crossed himself X - Pugh! - but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist. - No matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel. He had so; - nay, as it happened, he had</p>
            <pb n="167" xml:id="pb-167" facs="#i197"/>
            <p>better have done nothing at all; for in crossing himself he let go his whip, - and in attempting to save his whip between his knee and his saddle's skirt, as it slipped, he lost his stirrup, - in losing which he lost his seat; and in the multitude of all these losses (which by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind. So that without waiting for Obadiah's onset, he left his pony to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the style and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been) with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire.</p> <p>Obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to Dr. Slop; - once as he was falling, - and then again when he saw him seated. - Ill-timed complaisance; - had not the fellow better have stopped his horse, and got off and helped him? - Sir, he did all that his situation would allow; - but the MOMENTUM of the coach-horse was so great, that Obadiah could not do it all at once; he rode in a circle three times round Dr. Slop, before he could fully accomplish it any how; - and at last, when he did stop the beast, 'twas done with such an explosion of mud, that Obadiah had better have been a league off. In short, never was a Dr. Slop so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since that affair came into fashion.</p> <p>TRISTRAM SHANDY, C. XXXV. P. 187.</p>

In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no danger, - but to itself: - whereas the very essence of gravity was design, and consequently deceit; - 'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions, - it was no better, but often worse than what a French wit had long ago defined it, viz. - A misterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind.</p> <p>T.

Then ride the Scotch horse, quoth my father hastily. - He cannot bear a saddle upon his back, quoth Obadiah, for the whole world. - The devil's in that horse; then take PATRIOT, cried my father; and shut the door. - PATRIOT is sold, said Obadiah. Here's for you! cried my father, making a pause, and looking in my uncle Toby's face, as if the thing had not been a matter of fact. - Your worship ordered me to sell him last April, said Obadiah. - Then go on foot for your pains, cried</p>

Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment, by the twoko bs on the top of the back of it? - they are fastened on, you see, with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes and will place what I have to say in so clear a light, as to let you see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface, as plainly as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun-beams.</p> <p>I enter now directly upon the point.</p> <p>Here stands wit - and there stands judgment, close beside it, just like the two knobs I'm speaking of, upon the back of this self-same chair on which I am sitting.</p> <p> - You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its frame - as wit and judgment are of ours - and like them too, indubitably both made and fitted to go together, in order, as we say in all such cases of duplicated embellishments - to answer one another.</p> <p>Now for the sake of an experiment, and for the clearer illustrating this matter - let us for a moment</p>

Oh! he's dead, said Susannah - As sure, said the scullion, as I am alive.</p> <p>I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said Trim, fetching a sigh - Poor creature! - poor boy! - poor gentleman!</p> <p> - He was alive last Whitsuntide, said the coachman. Whitsuntide! alas! cried Trim, extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read the sermon, - what is Whitsuntide, Jonathan, (for that was the coachman's name), or Shrovetide, or any tide, or time past, to this?

'twould make a good-natur'd man's heart bleed, to consider, (continued the Corporal, standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that time! - And trust me, Susy, added the Corporal, turning to Susannah, whose eyes were swimming in water, - before that time comes round again, - many a bright eye will be dim. - Susannah placed it to the right side of the page - she wept - but she curt'sied too. - Are we not, continued Trim, looking still at Susannah, - are we not like a flower of the field - a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation - else no tongue could have described Susannah's affliction - is not all flesh grass?

(Susannah laid her hand upon Trim's shoulder) - but corruption? Susannah took it off.</p> <p> - Now I love you for this - and 'tis this delicious mixture within you, which makes you dear creatures what you are - And he who hates you for it - all I can say of the matter is - that he has either a pumpkin for his head - or a pippin for his heart, and whenever he is dissected, it will be found so.</p> <p>For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not death at all: - not this... added the Corporal, snapping his fingers, - but with an air which no one but the Corporal could have given to the sentiment. - In battle, I value death not this ... and let him not take me cowardly, like poor Joe Gibbins, in scouring his gun. - What is he?  A pull of a trigger - a push of a bayonet an inch this way or that - makes the difference. Look along the line - to the right - see! Jack's down! well, - 'tis worth a regiment of horse to him. - No - 'tis Dick. Then Jack's no worse. Never mind which, - we pass on, - in hot pursuit the would itself which brings him is not felt, - the best way is to stand up to him, the man who flies, is in ten times more danger than the man who marches up into his jaws. - I've look'd him, added the Corporal, an hundred times in the face, - and know what he is - He's nothing, Obadiah, at all in the field. - But he's</p>

An' please your honor, do not sigh so piteously, I would say to him as I laid beside him. I cannot help it, Trim, my master would say, - 'tis so melancholy an accident - I cannot get it off my heart. - Your honor fears not death yourself. - I hope, Trim, I fear nothing, he would say, but the doing a wrong thing. - Well, he would add, whatever betides, I will take care of Le Fevre's boy. - And with that, like a quieting draught, his honor would fall asleep.</p> <p>I like to hear Trim's stories about the Captain, said Susannah. - He is a kindly-hearted gentleman, said Obadiah, as ever lived. - Aye, - and as brave a one too, said the Corporal, as ever stept before a platoon. There never was a better officer in the king's army, or a better man in God's world; for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon, though he saw the lighted match at the very touch-hole, - and yet, for all that, he has a heart as soft as a child for other people. - He would not hurt a chicken. - I would sooner, quoth Jonathan, drive such a gentleman for</p>

He is a friend and a brother to me, - and could I be sure my poor brother Tom was dead, - continued the Corporal, taking out his handkerchief, - were I worth ten thousand pounds, I would leave ever shilling of it to the Captain. - Trim could not refrain from tears at this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master.

P. 25.</p> <p>THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE.</p> <p>PARIS.</p> <p>I STOPP'D at the Quai de Conti in my return home, to purchase a set of Shakspere.</p> <p>The bookseller said he had not a set in the world. - Comment! said I; taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us - He said, they were sent him only to be got bound, and were to be sent back to Versailles in the morning to the Count de B****.</p>

            <p> - And does the Count de B****, said I, read Shakspere? C'est un Esprit fort, replied the book seller. He loves English books; and what is more to his honor, Monsieur, he loves the English too. You speak this so civilly, said I, that it is enough to oblige an Englishman to lay out a louis-d'or or two at your shop - the bookseller made a bow, and was going to say something, when a young decent girl, of about twenty, who, by her air and dress, seemed to be Fille de Chambre to some devout man of fashion, came into the shop, and asked for Les Egarements du Coeur &amp; de l'Esprit: the bookseller gave her the book directly she pulled out a little green purse run round with a ribband of the same color, and putting her finger and thumb into it, she took out the money and paid for it. As I had nothing more to stay me in the shop we both walked out of the door together.</p> <p> - And what have you to do, my dear, said I, with The Wanderings of the Heart, who scarce know yet you have one? nor, till love has first told you it, or some faithless shepherd has made it ache, can'st thou eve be sure it is so. - Le Dieu m'en garde! said the girl - With what reason, said I, - for if it is a good one 'tis a pity it should be stolen: 'tis a little treasure to thee, and gives a better air to your face, than if i was dressed out with pearls.</p> <p>The young girl listened with a submissive attention holding her sattin purse by its ribband in her hand all the time - 'Tis a very small one, said I, taking hold of the bottom of it - she held it towards me - and</p>

            <p>there is very little in it, my dear, said I; but be as good as thou art handsome, and heaven will fill it: I had a parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakspere; and as she had let go the purse entirely, I put a single one in it; and tying up the ribband in a bow-knot, returned it to her.</p> <p>The young girl made me more an humble courtesy than a low one - it was one of those quiet, thankful sinkings where the spirit bows itself down - the body does no more than tell it. I never gave a girl a crown in my live which gave me half the pleasure.</p> <p>My advice, my dear, would not have been wroth a pin to you, said I, if I had not given this along with it: but now, when you see the crown, you will remember it - so do not, my dear, lay it out in ribbands.</p> <p>Upon my word, Sir, said the girl, earnestly, i am incapable - in saying which, as is usual in little bargains of honor, she gave me her hand - En vÃ©ritÃ©, Monsieur, je mettrai cet argent Ã  part, said she.</p> <p>When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it sanctifies their most private walks; so notwithstanding it was dusky, yet as both our roads lay the same way, we made no scruple of walking along the Quay de Conti together.</p> <p>She made me a second courtesy in setting off, and before we got twenty yards from the door, as if she had not done enough before, she made a sort of a little stop to tell me again - she thanked me.</p>

            <p>It was a small tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not be mistaken in the person I had been rendering it to for the world - but I see innocence, my dear, in your face - and foul befal the man who ever lays a snare in its way!</p> <p>The girl seemed affected some way or other with what I said - she gave a low sigh - I found I was not empowered to enquire at all after it - so said nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we were to part.</p> <p> - But is this the way, my dear, said I, to the hÃ´tel de Modene? she told me it was - or, that I might go by the Rue de Guenegvault, which was the next turn - Then I will go, my dear, by the Rue de Gueneguault, said I, for two reasons; first I shall please myself, and next I shall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can. The girl was sensible I was civil - and said she wished the hÃ´tel de Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre. - You live there, said I. She told me she was fille de chambre to Madam R**** - Good God! said I, it is the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens - The girl told me that Madam R****, she believed, expected a stranger with a letter, and was impatient to see him - so I desired the girl to present my compliments to Madam R****, and say I would certainly wait upon her in the morning.</p> <p>We stood still at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilst this passed - we then stoped a moment whilst</p>

            <p>she disposed of her Egarements du Coeur, more commodiously than carrying them in her hand - they were two volumes; so I held the second for her whilst she put the first into her pocket; and then she held her pocket, and I put the other in after it.</p> <p>It is sweet to feel by what fine-spun threads our affections are drawn together.</p> <p>We set off afresh, and as she took her third step, the girl put her hand within my arm - I was just bidding her - but she did it of herself, with the undeliberating simplicity, which shewed it was out of her head that she had never seen me before. For my own part, I felt the conviction of consanguinity so strongly, that I could not help turning half round to look in her face, and see if I could trace out any thing in it of a family likeness. Tut! said I, are we not all relations?</p> <p>When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Gueneguault, I stopped to bid her adieu for good and all: the girl would thank me again for my company and kindness - She bid me adieu twice - I repeated it as often; and so cordial was the parting between us, that had it happened any where else, I'm not sure but I should have signed it with a kiss of charity, as warm and as holy as an Apostle.</p> <p>But in Paris, as none kiss each other but the men - I did what amounted to the same thing - </p> <p> - I bid God bless her.</p> <p>SENT.

            <pb n="270" xml:id="pb-270" facs="#i304"/>
            <p>found, from observation upon the life of man, that the many troubles and infirmities of his nature, the sicknesses, disappointments, sorrows for the loss of children or property, with the numberless other calamities and cross accidents to which the life of man is subject, were in themselves so great, - and so little solid comfort to be administered from the mere refinements of philosophy in such emergencies, that there was no virtue which required greater efforts, or which was found so difficult to be atchieved upon moral principles - which had no foundation to sustain this great weight, which the infirmities of our nature laid upon it. And for this reason, 'tis observable, that there is no subject, upon which the moral writers of antiquity have exhausted so much of their eloquence, or where they have spent such time and pains, as in this of endeavouring to reconcile men to these evils. Insomuch, that from thence, in most modern languages, the patient enduring of affliction, has by degrees obtained the name of philosophy, and almost monopolized the word to itself, as if it were the chief end or compendium of all the wisdom which philosophy had to offer. And indeed, considering what lights they had, some of them wrote extremely well; yet, as what they said proceed more from the head than the heart, 'was generally more calculated to silence a man in his troubles, than to convince and teach him how to bear them. And therefore, however subtile and ingenious their arguments might appear in the reading, 'tis to be feared they lost much of their efficacy, when</p>

If a man were thrust back in the world by disappointments, or - as was Job's case - had suffered a sudden change in his fortunes, from an affluent condition were brought down by a train of cruel accidents, and pinched with poverty - philosophy would come in, and exhort him to stand his ground; - it would tell him that the same greatness and strength of mind which enabled him to behave well in the days of his prosperity, should equally enable him to behave well in the days of his adversity; - that it was the property only of weak and base spirits, who were insolent in the one, to be dejected and overthrown by the other; whereas great and generous souls were at all times calm and equal. - As they enjoyed the advantages of life with indifference, - they were able to resign them with the same temper, - and consequently - were out of the reach of fortune. All which, hower fine, and likely to satisfy the fancy of a man at ease, could convey but little consolation to a heart already pierced with sorrow; - nor is it to be conceived how an unfortunate creature should any more receive relief from such a lecture, however just, than a man racked with an acute fit of the gout or stone, could be supposed to be set free from torture, by hearing from his physician a nice dissertation upon his case. The philosophic consolations in sickness, or in afflictions for the death of friends and kindred, were just as efficacious; - and were rather in general to be considered as good sayings than good remedies. - So that, if a man were</p>

            <p>bereaved of a promising child, in whom all his hopes and expectations centered, - or a wife were left destitute to mourn the loss and protection of a kind and tender husband, Seneca or Epictetus would tell the pensive parent and disconsolate widow - that tears and lamentation for the dead were fruitless and absurd; that to die was the necessary and unavoidable debt of nature; - and as it could admit of no remedy - 'twas impious and foolish to grieve and fret themselves upon it.</p> <p>Upon such sage counsel, as well as many other lessons of the same stamp, the same reflection might be applied, which is said to have been made by one of the Roman Emperors, to one who administered the same consolations to him, on a like occasion, - to whom, advising him to be comforted, and make himself easy, since the event had been brought about by a fatality, and could not be helped, - he replied, "That this was so far from lessening his trouble, - that it was the very circumstance which occasioned it." - So that upon the whole - when the true value of these, and many more of their current arguments have been weighed and brought to the test, - one is led to doubt, whether the greatest part of their heroes, the most renowned for constancy, were not much more indebted to good nerves and spirits, or the natural happy frame of their tempers, for behaving well, than to any extraordinary helps, which they could be supposed to receive from their instructors.

He is commanded to arise and go to Zarephath, which belonged to Zidon, with an assurance that he had disposed the heart of a widow woman there to sustain him.</p> <p>The prophet follows the call of his GOD: the same hand which brought him to the gate of the city, had led also the poor widow out of her doors, oppressed with sorrow.

And he called unto her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. And as she was going to fetch it, he called unto her, and said,</p>

And Elijah said unto her, Fear not, but go, and do as thous hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after, make for thee and thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord send rain upon the earth.</p> <p>True charity is always unwilling to find excuses - else here was a fair opportunity of pleading many: she might have insisted over again upon her situation, which necessarily tied up her hands - she might have urged the unreasonableness of the request; - that she was reduced to the lowest extremity already - and that it was contrary to justice and the first law of nature, to rob herself and child of their last morsel, and give it to a stranger.</p> <p>But in generous spirits, compassion is sometimes more than a balance for self-preservation. For, as GOD certainly interwove that friendly softness in our nature to be a check upon too great a propensity towards self-love - so it seemed to operate here. For it is observable, that though the prophet backed his request with the promise of an immediate recompence in multiplying her stock; yet it is not evident, she was influenced at all by that temptation. For if she</p>
            <pb n="277" xml:id="pb-277" facs="#i311"/>
            <p>had, doubtless it must have wrought such a mixture of self-interest into the motive of her compliance, as must greatly have allayed the merit of the action. But this, I say, does not appear, but rather the contrary, from the reflection she makes upon the whole in the last verse of the chapter. Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.</p> <p>Besides, as she was an inhabitant of Zarephath (or, as it is called by St. Luke, Sarepta, subject to Sidon, the metropolis of Phoenicia, without the bounds of God's people), she had been brought up in gross darkness and idolatry, in utter ignorance of the Lord God of Israel: or, if she had heard of his name, which is all that seems probable, she had been taught to disbelieve the mighty wonders of his hand, and was still less likely to believe his prophet.</p> <p>Moreover, she might argue, If this man by some secret mystery of his own, or through the power of his GOD, be able to procure so preternatural a supply for me, whence comes it to pass, that he now stands in want himself, oppressed both with hunger and thirst?</p> <p>It appears, therefore, that she must have been wrought upon by an unmix'd principle of humanity. - She looked upon him as a fellow-partner almost in the same affliction with herself. - She considered he had come a weary pilgrimage, in a sultry climate, through an exhausted country; where neither bread or water were to be had, but by acts of liberality - </p>
            <pb n="278" xml:id="pb-278" facs="#i312"/>
            <p>That he had come an unknown traveller, and as a hard heart never wants pretence, that this circumstance, which should rather have befriended, might have helped to oppress him. - She considered, for charity is ever fruitful in kind reasons, that he was now far from his own country, and had strayed out of the reach of the tender offices of some one who affectionately mourned his absence - her heart was touched with pity. - She turned in silence, and went and did according as he had said. And behold, both she, and he, and her house, did eat many days; or, as in the margin, one whole year. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, until the day that God sent rain upon the earth.</p> <p>Though it may not seem necessary to raise conjectures here upon this event, yet it is natural to suppose, the danger of the famine being thus unexpectedly got over, that the mother began to look hopefully forwards for the rest of her days. There were many widows in Israel at that time, when the heavens were shut up for three years and six months, yet, as St. Luke observes, to none of them was the prophet sent, save to this widow of Sarpta: in all likelihood, she would not be the last in making the same observation, and drawing from it some flattering conclusion in favor of her son. - Many a parent would build high upon a worse foundation. - "Since the GOD of Israel has thus sent his own messenger to us in our distress, to pass by so many houses of his own people, and stop at mine, to save it in so miraculous</p>
            <pb n="279" xml:id="pb-279" facs="#i313"/>
            <p>a manner from destruction; doubtless, this is but an earnest of his future kind intentions to us: at least his goodness has decreed to comfort my old age by the long life and health of my son: - but perhaps, he has something greater still in store for him, and I shall live to see the same hand hereafter crown his head with glory and honor." We may naturally suppose her innocently carried away with such thoughts, when she is called back by an unexpected distemper which surprises her son, and in one moment brings down all her hopes - for his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him. - </p> <p>The expostulations of immoderate grief are seldom just. - For, though Elijah had already preserved her son, as well as herself, from immediate death, and was the last cause to be suspected of so sad an accident; yet the passionate mother in the first transport challenges him as the author of her misfortune; - and as if he had brought down sorrow upon a house which had so hospitably sheltered him. The prophet was too full of compassion to make reply to so unkind an accusation. He takes the dead child out of his mother's bosom, and laid him upon his own bed; and he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</p> <p>"Is this the reward of all her charity and goodness? Thou hast before this robbed her of the dear partner of all her joys and all her cares; and now that she is a widow, and has most reason to expect thy protection; behold thou hast withdraw her last</p>

            <p>prop: thou hast taken away her child, the only stay she had to rest on." - And Elijah cried unto God, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee let this child's soul come into him again.</p> <p>The prayer was urgent, and bespoke the distress of a humane mind deeply suffering in the misfortunes of another; - moreover his heart was rent with other passions - He was zealous for the name and honor of his GOD, and thought not only his omnipotence, but his glorious attribute of mercy, concerned in the event: for oh! with what triumph would the prophet retort his own bitter taunt, and say, his God was either talking, or he was pursuing, or was in a journey; or peradventure he slept and should have been awaked! - He was moreover involved in the success of his prayer himself; - honest minds are most hurt by scandal. - And he was afraid, lest so foul a one, so unworthy of his character, might arise among the heathen, who would report with pleasure, "Lo! the widow of Zarephath took the messenger of the GOD of Israel under her roof, and kindly entertained him, and see how she is rewarded; surely the prophet was ungrateful, he wanted power, or, what is worse, he wanted pity."</p> <p>Besides all this, he pleaded not the cause of the widow; it was the cause of charity itself, which had received a deep wound already, and would suffer still more should GOD deny it this testimony of his favor. So the Lord hearkened unto the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came unto him again, and he revived. And</p>
            <pb n="281" xml:id="pb-281" facs="#i315"/>
            <p>Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</p> <p>It would be a pleasure to a good mind to stop here a moment, and figure to itself the picture of so joyful an event. - To behold on one hand the raptures of the parent, overcome with surprise and gratitude, and imagine how a sudden stroke of such impetuous joy must operate on a despairing countenance, long accustomed to sadness. - To conceive on the other side of the piece, the holy man approaching with the child in his arms - full of honest triumph in his looks, but sweetened with all the kind sympathy which a gentle nature could overflow with upon so happy an event. It is a subject one might recommend to the pencil of a great genius, and would even afford matter for description here; but that it would lead us too far from the particular purpose, for which I have enlarged upon thus much of the story already; the chief design of which is, to illustrate by a fact, what is evident both in reason and scripture, that a charitable and good action is seldom cast away, but that even in this life it is more than probable, that what is so scattered shall be gathered again with increase. Cast thy bread upon the waters, and thou shalt find it after many days. Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husband unto their mother; so shalt thou be as a son of the Most High, and he will love thee more than thy mother doth. Be mindful of good turns, for thou knowest not what evil shall come upon the earth; and when thou fallest thou</p>
            <pb n="282" xml:id="pb-282" facs="#i316"/>
            <p>shalt find a stay. It shall preserve thee from all affliction, and fight for thee against thy enemies better than a mighty shield and a strong spear.</p> <p>The great instability of temporal affairs, and constant fluctuation of every thing in this world, afford perpetual occasions of taking refuge in such a security.</p> <p>What by successive misfortunes; by failings and cross accidents in trade;  by miscarriage of projects: - what by unsuitable expences of parents, extravagances of children, and the many other secret ways whereby riches make themselves wings and fly away; so many surprising revolutions do every day happen in families, that it may not seem strange to say, that the posterity of some of the most liberal contributors here, in the changes which one century may produce, may possibly find shelter under this very plant which now they so kindly water. Nay, so quickly sometimes has the wheel turned round, that many a man has lived to enjoy the benefit of that charity which his own piety projected.</p> <p>But besides this, and exclusive of the right which GOD's promise gives it to protection hereafter; charity and benevolence, in the ordinary chain of effects, have a natural and more immediate tendency in themselves to rescue a man from the accidents of the world, by softening the hearts, and winning every man's wishes to its interest. When a compassionate man falls, who would not pity him? who, that had power to do it, would not befriend and raise him up? or could the most barbarous temper offer an insult to his distress </p>
            <pb n="283" xml:id="pb-283" facs="#i317"/>
            <p>without pain and reluctance? so that it is almost a wonder that covetousness, even in spite of itself, does not sometimes argue a man into charity, by its own principle of looking forwards, and the firm expectation it would delight in of receiving its own again with usury. - So evident is it in the course of God's providence and the natural stream of things, that a good office one time or other generally meets with a reward - Generally, did I say? - how can it ever fail? - when besides all this, so large a share of the recompence is so inseparable even from the action itself. - Ask the man who has a tear of tenderness always ready to shed over the unfortunate; who, withal, is ready to distribute and willing to communicate: ask him if the best things, which wits have said of pleasure, have expressed what he has felt, when, by a seasonable kindness, he has made the heart of the widow sing for joy. Mark then the expressions of unutterable pleasure and harmony in his looks; and say, whether Solomon has not fixed the point of true enjoyment in the right place, when he declares, "that he knew no good there was in any of the riches or honors of this world, but for a man to do good with them in his life." Nor was it without reason he made this judgment. - Doubtless he had found and seen the insufficiency of all sensual pleasures; how unable to furnish either a rational or a lasting scheme of happiness: how soon the best of them vanished: the less exceptionable in vanity, but the guilty both in vanity and vexation of spirit. But that this was of so pure and refined a nature,</p>

            <p>it burned without consuming: it was figuratively the widow's barrel of meal which wasted not, and cruse of oil which never failed.</p> <p>It is not an easy matter to add weight to the testimony of the wisest man, upon the pleasure of doing good; or else the evidence of the philosopher Epicurus is very remarkable, whose word in this matter is the more to be trusted, because a professed sensualist; who, amidst all the delicacies and improvements of pleasure which a luxuriant fancy might strike out, still maintained that the best way of enlarging human happiness was, by a communication of it to others.</p> <p>And if it were necessary here, or there were time to refine upon this doctrine, one might farther maintain, exclusive of the happiness which the mind itself feels in the exercise of this virtue, that the body of man is never in a better state than when he is most inclined to do good offices: - that as nothing more contributes to health than a benevolence of temper, so nothing generally was a stronger indication of it.</p> <p>And what seems to confirm this opinion, is an observation, the truth of which must be submitted to every one's reflection - namely - that a disinclination and backwardness to do good, is often attended, if not produced, by an indisposition of the animal as well as rational part of us: - So naturally do the soul and body, as in other cases so in this, mutually befriend, or prey upon each other. And indeed, setting aside all abstruser reasoning upon the point, I cannot conceive but that the very mechanical motions which maintain</p>
            <pb n="285" xml:id="pb-285" facs="#i319"/>
            <p>life, must be performed with more equal vigor and freedom in that man whom a great and good soul perpetually inclines to shew mercy to the miserable, than they can be in a poor, sordid, selfish wretch, whose little contracted heart melts at no man's afflictions; but sits brooding so intently over its own plots and concerns, as to see and feel nothing; and in truth, enjoy nothing beyond himself: and of whom one may say what that great master of nature has, speaking of a natural sense of harmony, which I think with more justice may be said of compassion, that the man who had it not, - </p> <p> - Was fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils:</p> <p>The MOTIONS of his spirits are dull as night;</p> <p>And his affections dark as EREBUS:</p> <p> - Let no such man be trusted. - </p> <p>What divines say of the mind, naturalists have observed of the body; that there is no passion so natural to it as love, which is the principle of doing good; - and though instances, like this just mentioned, seem far from being proofs of it, yet it is not to be doubted, but that every hard-hearted man has felt much inward opposition before he could prevail upon himself to do aught to fix and deserve the character: and what we say of long habits of vice, that they are hard to be subdued, may with equal truth be said concerning the natural impressions of benevolence, that a man must do much violence to himself, and suffer many a painful struggle, before he can tear away so great and noble a part of</p>
            <pb n="286" xml:id="pb-286" facs="#i320"/>
            <p>his nature. - Of this, antiquity has preserved a beautiful instance in an anecdote of Alexander, the tyrant of Pheres, who, though he had so industriously hardened his heart as to seem to take delight in cruelty, insomuch as to murder many of his subjects every day, without cause and without pity; yet, as the bare representation of a tragedy which related the misfortunes of Hecuba and Andromache, he was so touched with the fictitious distress which the poet had wrought up in it, that he burst out into a flood of tears. The explication of which inconsistency is easy, and casts as great a lustre upon human nature, as the man himself was a disgrace to it. The case seems to have been this: in real life he had been blinded with passions, and thoughtlessly hurried on by interest or resentment: - but here, there was no room for motives of that kind; so that his attention being first caught hold of, and all his vices laid asleep; - then NATURE awoke in triumph, and shewed how deeply she had sown the seeds of compassion in every man's breast; when tyrants, with vices the most at enmity with it, were not able entirely to root it out.</p> <p>But this is painting an amiable virtue, and setting her off with shades which wickedness lends us, when one might safely trust to the force of her own natural charms, and ask, Whether any thing under Heaven, in its own nature, is more lovely and engaging? - To illustrate this the more, let us turn our thoughts within ourselves, and for a moment let any number of us here imagine ourselves at this instant engaged in</p>
            <pb n="287" xml:id="pb-287" facs="#i321"/>
            <p>drawing the most perfect and amiable character, such as, according to our conceptions of the Deity, we should think most acceptable to him, and most likely to be universally admired by all mankind. - I appeal to your own thoughts, whether the first idea which offered itself to most of our imaginations would not be that of a compassionate benefactor, stretching forth his hands to raise up the helpless orphan? whatever other virtues we should give our hero, we should all agree in making him a generous friend, who thought the opportunities of doing good to be the only charm of his prosperity: we should paint him like the psalmist's river of God, overflowing the thirsty parts of the earth, that he might enrich them, carrying plenty and gladness along with him. If this were not sufficient, and we were still desirous of adding a farther degree of perfection to so great a character; we should endeavor to think of some one, if human nature could furnish such a pattern, who, if occasion required, was willing to undergo all kinds of affliction, to sacrifice himself, to forget his dearest interests, and even lay down his life for the good of mankind. - And here, - O merciful SAVIOUR! how would the bright original of thy unbounded goodness break in upon our hearts! Thou who becamest poor, that we might be rich - though Lord of all this world, yet hadst not where to lay thy head - and though equal in power and glory to the great GOD of NATURE, yet madest thyself of no reputation, tookest upon thee the form of a servant, - submitting thyself, without opening thy mouth, to all</p>
            <pb n="288" xml:id="pb-288" facs="#i322"/>
            <p>indignities which a thankless and undiscerning people could offer; and at length, to accomplish our salvation, becamest obedient unto death, suffering thyself, as on this day*, to be led like a lamb to the slaughter.</p> <p>The consideration of this stupendous instance of compassion, in the Son of GOD, is the most unanswerable appeal that can be made to the heart of man, for the reasonableness of it in himself. - It is the great argument which the Apostles use in almost all their exhortations to good works. - Beloved, if Christ so loved us - the inference is unavoidable; and gives strength and beauty to every thing else which can be urged upon the subject. And therefore I have reserved it for my last and warmest appeal, with which I would gladly finish this discourse, that at least for their sakes for whom it is preached, we might be left to the full impression of so exalted and so seasonable a motive. - That by reflecting upon the infinite labor of this day's love, in the instance of CHRIST'S death, we may consider what an immense debt we owe each other; and by calling to mind the amiable pattern of his life, in doing good, we might learn in what manner we may best discharge it.</p> <p>And, indeed, of all the methods in which a good mind would be willing to do it, I believe there can be none more beneficial, or comprehensive in its effects, than that for which we are here met together - The proper education of poor children being the</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Preached on Good-Friday.</p>
            <pb n="289" xml:id="pb-289" facs="#i323"/>
            <p>ground-work of almost every other kind of charity, as that which makes every other subsequent act of it answer the pious expectation of the giver.</p> <p>Without this foundation first laid, how much kindness, in the progress of a benevolent man's life, is unavoidably cast away! and sometimes where it is a senseless as the exposing a tender plant to all the inclemencies of a cruel season, and then going with sorrow to take it in, when the root is already dead. I said, therefore, this was the foundation of almost every kind of charity, - and might one not have added, of all the policy too? since the many ill consequences which attend the want of it, though grievously felt by the parties themselves, are no less so by the community of which they are members; and moreover, of all mischiefs seem the hardest to be redressed - Insomuch, that when one considers the disloyal seductions of popery on one hand, and on the other, that no bad man, whatever he professes, can be a good subject, one may venture to say, it had been cheaper and better for the nation to have borne the expence of instilling sound principles and good morals into the neglected children of the lower sort, especially in some parts of Great-Britain, than to be obliged, so often as we have been within this last century, to rise up and arm ourselves against the rebellious effects which the want of them has brought down even to our doors. And, in fact, if we are to trust antiquity, the truth of which in this case we have no reason to dispute, this matter has been looked upon of such vast importance</p>

            <p>to civil happiness and peace of a people, that some commonwealths, the most eminent for political wisdom, have chosen to make a public concern of it; thinking it much safer to be entrusted to the prudence of the magistrate, than to the mistaken tenderness, or natural partiality, of the parent.</p> <p>It was consistent with this, and bespoke a very refined sense of policy in the Lacedaemonians (though by the way, I believe, different from what more modern politics would have directed in like circumstances), when Antipater demanded of them fifty children, as hostages for the security of a distant engagement, they made this brave and wise answer, "they would not, - they could not consent: - they would rather give him double the number of their best grown up men." - Intimating, that, however they were distressed, they would chuse any inconvenience rather than suffer the loss of their country's education; and the opportunity (which if once lost can never be regained) of giving their youth an early tincture of religion, and bringing them up to a love of industry, and a love of the laws and constitution of their country. If this shews the great importance of a proper education to children of all ranks and conditions, what shall we say then of those whom the providence of God has placed in the very lowest lot of life, utterly cast out of the way of knowledge, without a parent, - sometimes, may be, without a friend to guide and instruct them, but what common pity and the necessity of their sad situation engage: - where the</p>

Should a heathen, a stranger to our holy religion and the love it taught, should he, as he journeyed, come to the place where she lay, when he saw, would not he have compassion on her?

            <p>THE HISTORY OF A WATCH COAT.</p> <p> - "For some time Mr. Sterne lived, in a retired manner, upon a small curacy in Yorkshire, and probably would have remained in the same obscurity, if his lively genius had not displayed itself upon an occasion which secured him a friend, and paved the way for his promotion. A person who filled a lucrative benefice, was not satisfied with enjoying it during his own life-time, but exerted all his interest to have it entailed on his wife and son after his decease: the gentleman that expected the reversion of this post was Mr. Sterne's friend, who had not, however, sufficient influence to prevent the success of his adversary. - At this time Sterne's satirical pen operated so strongly, that the intended monopolizer informed him, if he would suppress the publication of his sarcasm, he would resign his pretensions to the next candidate."</p> <p>The title of this piece, it appears, was to have been, "The History of a good warm Watch-Coat, with which the present possessor is not content to cover his own shoulders, unless he can cut out of it a petticoat for his wife, and a pair of breeches for his son."*</p> <p>A LETTER FROM MR.

            <p>parson* of the parish and the said Master Trim, about an old watch-coat that had hung up many years in the church, which Trim had set his heart upon; and nothing would serve Trim but he must take it home in order to have it converted into a warm under-petticoat for his wife, and a jerkin for himself against winter; which, in a plaintive tone, he most humbly begged his reverence would consent to.</p> <p>I need not tell you, Sir, who have so often felt it, that a principle of strong compassion transports a generous mind sometimes beyond what is strictly right; - the parson was within an ace of being an honorable example of this very crime - for no sooner did the distinct words - Petticoat - poor wife - warm - winter, strike upon the ear - but his heart warmed - and before Trim had well got to the end of his petition (being a gentleman of a frank open temper) he told him he was welcome to it with all his heart and soul. - But, Trim, says he, as you see I am but just got down to my living, and am an utter stranger to all parish matters, knowing nothing about this old watch-coat you beg of me, having never seen it in my life, and therefore cannot be a judge whether 'tis fit for such a purpose, or, if it is, in truth know not whether 'tis mine to bestow upon you or not - you must have a week or ten day's patience, 'till I can make some inquiries about it - and, if I find it is in my power, I tell you again, man, your wife is heartily welcome to an under-petticoat</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Apb. H-tt-on.</p>

            <p>out of it, and you to a jerkin, were the thing as good again as you represent it.</p> <p>It is necessary to inform you, Sir, in this place, that the parson was earnestly bent to serve Trim in this affair, not only from the motive of generosity, which I have justly ascribed to him, but likewise from another motive, and that was my making some sort of recompence for a multitude of small services which Trim had occasionally done, and indeed was continually doing (as he was much about the house) when his own man was out of the way. - For all these reasons together, I say, the parson of the parish intended to serve Trim in this matter to the utmost of his power. All that was wanting, was previously to inquire if any any one had a claim to it, or whether, as it had, time immemorial, hung up in the church, the taking it down might raise a clamor in the parish. These inquiries were the things that Trim dreaded in his heart - he knew very well, that, if the parson should but say one word to the church-wardens about it, there would be an end of the whole affair. For this, and some other reasons not necessary to be told you at present, Trim was for allowing no time in this matter - but on the contrary doubled his diligence and importunity at the vicarage house - plagued the whole family to death - pressed his suit morning, noon, and night, and, to shorten my story, teazed the poor gentleman, who was but in an ill state of health, almost out of his life about it.</p>
            <pb n="298" xml:id="pb-298" facs="#i332"/>
            <p>You will not wonder when I tell you, that all this hurry and precipitation, on the side of master Trim, produced its natural effect on the side of the parson, and that was, a suspicion that all was not right at the bottom.</p> <p>He was one evening sitting alone in his study, weighing and turning this doubt every way in his mind, and after an hour and a half's serious deliberation upon the affair, and running over Trim's behaviour throughout - he was just saying to himself - it must be so - when a sudden rap at the door put an end to his soliloquy, and in a few minutes to his doubts too; for a laborer in the town, who deemed himself past his fifty-second year, had been returned by the constables in the militia list - and he had come with a groat in his hand to search the parish-register for his age. The parson bid the poor fellow put the groat into his pocket, and go into the kitchen - then shutting the study door, and taking down the parish register - who knows, says he, but I may find something here about this self same watch-coat? He had scarce unclasped the book, in saying this, when he popped on the very thing he wanted, fairly wrote in the first page, pasted to the inside of one of the covers, whereon was a memorandum about the very thing in question in these express words. - Memorandum. - "The great watch-coat was purchased and given, about two hundred years ago, by the lord of the manor, to the parish church, to the sole use and behoof of the poor sexton thereof, and their successors</p>
            <pb n="299" xml:id="pb-299" facs="#i333"/>
            <p>for ever, to be worn by them respectively in winterly cold nights, in ringing complines, passing bells, &amp;c. which the said lord of the manor had done in piety to keep the poor wretches warm, and for the good of his own soul, for which they were directed to pray, &amp;c." Just heaven! said the parson to himself, looking upwards, what an escape have I had! Give this for an under-petticoat to Trim's wife! I would not have consented to such a desecration to be Primate of all England - nay, - I would not have disturbed a single button of it for all my tithes.</p> <p>Scarce were the words out his mouth, when in pops Trim with the whole subject of the exclamation under both his arms - I say under both his arms - for he had actually got it ript and cut out ready, his own jerkin under one arm, and the petticoat under the other, in order to carry to the taylor to be made up, and had just stepped in, in high spirits, to show the parson how cleverly it had held out.</p> <p>There are not many good similes subsisting in the world, but which I have neither time to recollect or look for, which would give you a strong conception of the astonishment and honest indignation which this unexpected stroke of Trim's impudence impressed upon the parson's looks - let it suffice to say, that it exceeded all fair description - as well as all power of proper resentment - except this, that Trim was ordered, in a stern voice, to lay the bundles down upon the table - to go about his business, and wait upon him at his peril, the next morning at eleven precisely. - </p>
            <pb n="300" xml:id="pb-300" facs="#i334"/>
            <p>Against this hour, like a wise man, the parson had sent to desire John the parish clerk, who bore an exceeding good character as a man of truth, and who, having moreover a pretty freehold of about eighteen pounds a year in the township, was a leading man in it; and, upon the whole, was such a one, of whom it might be said, that he rather did honor to his office than his office did honor to him - him he sends for, with the churchwardens, and one of the sidemen, a grave, knowing old man, to be present - for, as Trim had with-held the whole truth from the parson touching the watch-coat, he thought it probable he would certainly do the same thing to others. Though this, I said, was wise, the trouble of the precaution might have been spared - because the parson's character was unblemished - and he had ever been held by the world in the estimation of a man of honor and integrity. - Trim's character, on the contrary was as well known, if not in the world, at least in all the parish, to be that of a little, dirty, pimping, pettyfogging, ambidextrous fellow - who neither cared what he did or said of any, provided he could get a penny by it. This might, I said, have made any precaution needless - but you must know, as the parson had in a manner but just got down to his living, he dreaded the consequences of the least ill impression on his first entrance among his parishioners, which would have disabled him from doing the good he wished - so that out of regard to his flock, more than the necessary care due to himself,</p>
            <pb n="301" xml:id="pb-301" facs="#i335"/>
            <p>he was resolved not to lie at the mercy of what resentment might vent, or malice lend an ear to. - </p> <p>Accordingly the whole matter was rehearsed, from first to the last, by the parson, in the manner I've told you, in the hearing of John the parish clerk, and in the presence of Trim.</p> <p>Trim had little to say for himself, except "that the parson had absolutely promised to befriend him and his wife in the affair to the utmost of his power; that the watch-coat was certainly in his power, and that he might still give it him if he pleased."</p> <p>To this the parson's reply was short, but strong, "That nothing was in his power to do but what he could do honestly - that, in giving the coat to him and his wife, he should do a manifest wrong to the next sexton, the great watch-coat being the most comfortable part of the place - that he should moreover injure the right of his own successor, who would be just so much a worse patron as the worth of the coat amounted to; and, in a word, he declared, that his whole intent in promising that coat was charity to Trim, but wrong to no man - that was a reserve, he said, made in all cases of this kind: and he declared solemnly, in verbo sacerdotis, <note>Latin</note> that this was his meaning, and was so understood by Trim himself."</p> <p>With the weight of this truth, and the great good sense and strong reason which accompanied all the parson said on the subject - poor Trim was driven to the last shift - and begged he might be suffered to plead his right and title to the watch-coat, if not by promise,</p>
            <pb n="302" xml:id="pb-302" facs="#i336"/>
            <p>at least by servitude - it was well known how much he was intitled to it upon these scores: that he had black'd the parson's shoes without count, and greased his boots above fifty times - that he had run for eggs in the town upon all occasions - whetted the knives at all hours - catched his horse, and rubbed him down - that, for his wife, she had been ready upon all occasions to char for them; and neither he nor she, to the best of his remembrance, ever took a farthing, or any thing beyond a mug of ale. - To this account of his services, he begged leave to add those of his wishes, which, he said, had been equally great - he affirmed, and was ready, he said, to make it appear, by a number of witnesses, he had drank his reverence's health a thousand times (by the bye he did not add, out of the parson's own ale) - that he had not only drank his health, but wished it, and never came to the house but asked his man kindly how he did, that in particular, about half a year ago, when his reverence cut his finger in paring an apple, he went half a mile to ask a cunning woman what was good to staunch blood, and actually returned with a cobweb in his breeches pocket. Nay, says Trim, it was not a fortnight ago, when your reverence took that strong purge, that I went to the far end of the whole town to borrow you a close-stool - and came back, as the neighbours, who flouted me, will bear witness, with the pan upon my head, and never thought it too much." Trim concluded this pathetic remonstrance with saying "he hoped his reverence's heart would</p>
            <pb n="303" xml:id="pb-303" facs="#i337"/>
            <p>not suffer him to requite so many faithful services by so unkind a return: - that if it was so, he was the first, so he hoped he should be the last example of a man of his condition so treated." This Plan of Trim's defence, which Trim had put himself upon, could admit of no other reply than a general smile. - Upon the whole, let me inform you, that all that could be said pro and con, on both sides, being fairly heard, it was plain that Trim in very part of this affair had behaved very ill - and only thing, which was never expected to be known of him, happened in the course of this debate to come out against him, namely, that he had gone and told the parson, before he had ever set foot in the parish, that John, his parish clerk - his church-wardens, and some of the heads of the parish, were a parcel of scoundrels. Upon the upshot, Trim was kick'd out of doors, and told at his peril never to come there again.</p> <p>At first, Trim huff'd and bounced most terribly - swore he would get a warrant - that nothing would serve him but he would call a bye-law, and tell the whole parish how the parson had misused him: but cooling of that, as fearing the parson might possible bind him over to his good behaviour, and, for aught he knew, might send him to the house of correction, he lets the parson alone, and to revenge himself, falls upon the poor clerk, who had no more to do in the quarrel than you or I - rips up the promise of the old - cast - pair of black - plush - breeches; and raises an uproar in the town about it, notwithstanding it had</p>
            <pb n="304" xml:id="pb-304" facs="#i338"/>
            <p>slept ten years - but all this, you must know, is looked upon in no other light but as an artful stroke of generalship in Trim to raise a dust and cover himself under the disgraceful chastisement he has undergone. - </p> <p>If your curiosity is not yet satisfied - I will now proceed to relate the battle of the breeches in the same manner I have done that of the watchcoat. - </p> <p>Be it known then, that about ten years ago, when John was appointed parish-clerk of this church, this said Trim took no small pains to get into John's good graces, in order, as it afterwards appeared, to coax a promise out of him of a pair of breeches, which John had then by him, of black plush, not much the worse for wearing - Trim only begged, for God's sake, to have them bestowed upon him when John should think fit to cast them. - </p> <p>Trim was one of those kind of men who loved a bit of finery in his heart, and would rather have a tatter'd rag of another body's than the best plain whole thing his wife could spin him.</p> <p>John, who was naturally unsuspicious, made no more difficulty in promising the breeches than the parson had done in promising the great coat; and indeed with something less reserve - because the breeches were John's own, and he could give them, without wrong, to whom he thought fit.</p> <p>It happened, I was going to say unluckily, for Trim, for he was the only gainer by it, that a quarrel, about some six or eight weeks after this, broke out betwixt the late parson of the parish and John the clerk. - </p>
            <pb n="305" xml:id="pb-305" facs="#i339"/>
            <p>Somebody (and it was thought to be nobody but Trim) had put it into the parson's head, "that John's desk in the church was at least four inches higher than it should be - that the thing gave offence, and was indecorous, inasmuch as it approached too near upon a level with the parson's desk itself. - This hardship the parson complained of loudly, and told John, one day after prayers, "he could bear it no longer - and would have it altered, and brought down as it should be." John made no other reply, but "that the desk was not of his raising: - that 'twas not one hair breadth higher than he found it - and that as he found it so he would leave it. - In short, he would neither make an encroachment, neither would he suffer one." The * late parson might have his virtues, but the leading part of his character was not humility - so that John's stiffness in this point was not likely to reconcile matters. - This was Trim's harvest.</p> <p>After a friendly hint to John to stand his ground, away hies Trim to make his market at the vicarage. - What passed there I will not say, intending not to be uncharitable; so shall content myself with only guessing at it from the sudden change that appeared in Trim's dress for the better - for he had left his old ragged coat, hat, and wig, in the stable, and was come forth strutting across the church-yard, clad in a good charitable cast coat, large hat, and wig, which the parson had just given him. - Ho! ho! hollo! John, cries</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Abp. H-rr-g.</p>
            <pb n="306" xml:id="pb-306" facs="#i340"/>
            <p>Trim, in an insolent bravo, as loud as he could bawl - see here, my lad, how fine I am! - The more shame for you, answered John seriously - Do you think, Trim, says he, such finery, gained by such services, becomes you, or can wear well? - Fy upon it, Trim, I could not have expected this from you, considering what friendship you pretended, and how kind I have ever been to you - how many shillings and sixpensces, I have generously lent you in your distresses. - Nay, it was but the other day that I promised you these black plush breeches I have on. - Rot your breeches, quoth Trim (for Trim's brain was half turn'd with his new finery) rot your breeches, says he - I would not take them up were they laid at my door - give them, and be d-d to you, to whom you like - I would have you to know I can have a better pair of the parson's any day in the week. - John told him plainly, as his word had once passed him, he had a spirit above taking advantage of his insolence in giving them away to another - but, to tell him his mind freely, he thought he had got so many favors of that kind, and was so likely to get many more for the same services, of the parson, that he had better give up the breeches, with good-nature, to some one who would be more thankful for them.</p> <p>Here John mentioned * Mark Slender (who, it seems, the day before had asked John for them) not knowing they were under promise to Trim - "Come, Trim, says he, let poor Mark have them - you know he has not a pair to his a-: besides, you see he is just of my</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>*Dr. Braith-t.</p>
            <pb n="307" xml:id="pb-307" facs="#i341"/>
            <p>size, and they will fit to a T; whereas if I give 'em to you, look ye, they are not worth much; and besides, you could not get your backside into them, if you had them; without tearing them all to pieces." - Every tittle of this was most undoubtedly true, for Trim, you must know, by foul feeding, and playing the good fellow at the parson's, was grown somewhat gross about the lower parts, if not higher; so that, as all John said upon the occasion was fact, Trim with much ado, and after a hundred hums and hahs, at last, out of mere compassion to Mark, signs, seals, and delivers up ALL RIGHT, INTEREST, AND PRETENSIONS WHATSOEVER, IN, AND TO THE SAID BREECHES, THEREBY BINDING HIS HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS, NEVER MORE TO CALL THE SAID CLAIM IN QUESTION. - All this renunciation was set forth, in an ample manner, to be be in pure pity to Mark's nakedness - but the secret was, Trim had an eye to, and firmly expected, in his own mind, the great green pulpit cloth, and old velvet cushion, which were that very year to be taken down - which, by the bye, could he have wheedled John a second time, as he had hoped, would have made up the loss of the breeches seven-fold.</p> <p>Now, you must know, this pulpit-cloth and cushion were not in John's gift, but in the churchwardens, &amp;c. However, as I said above, that John was a leading man in the parish, Trim knew he could help him to 'em if he would - but John had got a surfeit of him - so, when the pulpit-cloth, &amp;c, were taken down, they</p>
            <pb n="308" xml:id="pb-308" facs="#i342"/>
            <p>were immediately given (John having a great say in it) to * William Doe, who understood very well what use to make of them.</p> <p>As for the old breeches, poor Mark lived to wear them but a short time, and they got into the possession of Â§ Lorry Slim, an unlucky wight, by whom they are still worn - in truth, as you will guess, they are very thin by this time.</p> <p>But Lorry has a light heart, and what recommends them to him is this, that, as thin as they are, he knows that Trim, let him say what he will to the contrary, still envies the possessor of them, and with all his pride would be very glad to wear them after him.</p> <p>Upon this footing have these affairs slept quietly for near ten years - and would have slept for ever, but for the unlucky kicking bout, which, as I said, has ripped this squabble up afresh; so that it was no longer ago than last week, that Trim met and insulted John in the public town-way before a hundred people - tax'd him with the promise of the old cast pair of black breeches, notwithstanding Trim's solemn renunciation - twitted him with the pulpit-cloth and velvet cushion - as good as told him he was ignorant of the common duties of his clerkship; adding, very insolently, that he knew not so much as to give out a common psalm in tune.</p> <p>John contented himself by giving a plain answer to every article that Trim had laid to his charge, and appealed to his neighbours who remembered the whole</p> <note>* Mr. Birdm-e.

            <pb n="309" xml:id="pb-309" facs="#i343"/>
            <p>affair - and, as he knew there was never any thing to be got by wrestling with a chimney-sweeper, he was going to take his leave of Trim for ever. But hold - the mob by this time had got round them, and their high mightinesses insisted upon having Trim tried upon the spot. - </p> <p>Trim was accordingly tried, and, after a full hearing, was convicted a second time, and handled more roughly by one or more of them than even at the parson's. - </p> <p>Trim, says one, are you not ashamed of yourself to make all this rout and disturbance in the town, and set neighbours together by the ears, about an old - worn - out - pair of cast - breeches, not worth half a crown? Is there a cast coat, or a place in the whole town, that will bring you in a shilling, but what you have snapped up, like a greedy hound as you are?</p> <p>In the first place, are you not sexton and dog-whipper, worth three pounds a year? Then you begged the church-wardens to let your wife have the washing and darning of the church-linen, which brings you in thirteen shillings and four-pence; then you have six shillings and eight-pence for oiling and winding up the clock, both paid you at Easter - the pounder's place, which is worth forty shillings a year, you have got that too - you are the bailiff, which the late parson got you, which brings you in forty shillings more.</p> <p>Besides all this, you have six pounds a year, paid you quarterly, for being mole-catcher to the parish. - </p>
            <pb n="310" xml:id="pb-310" facs="#i344"/>
            <p>Aye, says the luckless wight above-mentioned (who was standing close by him with the plush breeches on) "you are not only mole-catcher, Trim, but you catch STRAY CONIES too in the dark, and you pretend a licence for it, which, I trow, will be looked into at the next quarter sessions." I maintain it, I have a licence, says Trim, blushing as read as scarlet - I have a licence, and, as I farm a warren in the next parish, I will catch conies every hour of the night. You catch conies! says a toothless old woman just passing by.</p> <p>This set the mob a laughing, and sent every man home in perfect humour, except Trim, who waddled very slowly off with that kind of inflexible gravity only to be equalled by one animal in the creation, and surpassed by none.</p> <p>I am,</p> <p>Sir, yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT.</p> <p>I Have broke open my letter to inform you, that I missed the opportunity of sending it by the messenger, who I expected would have called upon me in his return through this village to York; so it has lain a week or ten days by me - I am not sorry for the disappointment, because something has since happened, in continuation of this affair, which I am thereby enabled to transmit to you all under one trouble.</p> <p>When I finished the above account, I thought (as did every soul in the parish) Trim had met with so</p>
            <pb n="311" xml:id="pb-311" facs="#i345"/>
            <p>thorough a rebuff from John the parish clerk, and the town's folks, who all took against him, that Trim would be glad to be quiet, and let the matter rest.</p> <p>But it seems, it is not half an hour ago since Trim sallied forth again, and, having borrowed a sowgelder's horn, with hard blowing he got the whole town round him, and endeavoured to raise a disturbance, and fight the whole battle over again - alledged that he had been used in the last fray worse than a dog, not by John the parish clerk, for he should not, quoth Trim, have valued him a rush single-hands - but all the town sided with him, and twelve men in buckram set upon me, all at once, and kept me in play at sword's point for three hours together.</p> <p>Besides, quoth Trim, there were two misbegotten knaves in Kendal-green, who lay all the while in ambush in John's own house, and they all sixteen came upon my back, and let drive at me all together - a plague, says Trim, of all cowards.</p> <p>Trim repeated this story above a dozen times, which made some of the neighbours pity him, thinking the poor fellow cracked-brained, and that he actually believed what he said.</p> <p>After this, Trim dropped the affair of the breeches, and began a fresh dispute about the reading-desk, which I told you had occasioned some small dispute between the late parson and John some years ago. - This reading-desk, as you will observe, was but an episode woven into the main story by the bye, for the main affair was the battle of the breeches and the great coat.</p>
            <pb n="312" xml:id="pb-312" facs="#i346"/>
            <p>However, Trim being at last driven out of these two citadels - he has seized hold, in his retreat, of this reading-desk, with a view, as it seems, to take shelter behind it.</p> <p>I cannot say but the man has fought it out obstinately enough, and, had his cause been good, I should have really pitied him. For, when he was driven out of the great watch-coat, you see he did not run away; no - he retreated behind the breeches; and, when he could make nothing of it behind the breeches he got behind the reading-desk. To what other hold Trim will next retreat, the politicians of this village are not agreed. Some think his next move will be towards the rear of the parson's boot; but, as it is thought he cannot make a long stand there, others are of opinion, that Trim will once more in his life get hold of the parson's horse, and charge upon him, or perhaps behind him: but as the horse is not easy to be caught, the more general opinion is, that, when he is driven out of the reading-desk, he will make his last retreat in such a manner, as, if possible, to gain the closestool, and defend himself behind it to the very last drop.</p> <p>If Trim should make this movement, by my advice he should be left beside his citadel, in full possession of the field of battle, where 'tis certain he will keep every body a league off, and may hop by himself 'till he is weary. Besides, as Trim seems bent on purging himself, and may have abundance of foul humors to work off, I think it cannot be better placed.</p>
            <pb n="313" xml:id="pb-313" facs="#i347"/>
            <p>But this is all speculation - Let me carry you back to matter of fact, and tell you what kind of stand Trim has actually made behind the said desk: "Neighbours and townsmen all, I will be sworn before my lord mayor, that John and his nineteen men in buckram have abused me worse than a dog; for they told you I play'd fast and go loose with the late parson and him, in that old dispute of theirs about the reading-desk, and that I made matters worse between them, and not better."</p> <p>Of this charge Trim declared he was as innocent as the child that was unborn - that he would be book-sworn he had no hand in it.</p> <p>He produced a strong witness, and moreover insinuated, that John himself, instead of being angry for what he had done in it, had actually thanked him - Aye, Trim, says the wight in the plush breeches, but that was, trim, the day before John found thee out. Besides, Trim, there is nothing in that, for the very year that you was made town's pounder, thou knowest well that I both thanked thee myself, and moreover gave thee a good warm supper for turning John Lund's cows and horses out of my hard corn close, which if thou hadst not done, (as thou toldst me) I should have lost my whole crop; whereas John Lund and Thomas Patt, who are both here to testify, and are both willing to take their oaths on't, that thou thyself were the very man who set the gate open - and after all, it was not thee, Trim, 'twas the blacksmith's poor lad who turned them out - so that a man may be thanked and</p>
