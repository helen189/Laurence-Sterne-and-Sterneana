                    <p>Sir, In my last, for want of something better to write about, I told you what a World of Fending and Proving we have had of late, in this little Village of ours, about an old-cast-Pair-of-black-Plush-Breeches, which John, our Parish-Clerk, about ten Years ago, it seems, had made a Promise of to one Trim, who in our Sexton and Dog-Whipper. - To this you write me Word, that you have had more than either one or two Occasions to know a good deal of the shifty Behaviour of this said Master Trim, - and that</p>
                    <pb n="2">
                        <p>you are astonished, nor can you for your Soul conceive, how so worthless a Fellow, and so worthless a Thing into the Bargain, could become the Occasion of such a Racket as I have represented.</p> <p>Now, though you do not say expressly, you could wish to hear any more about it, yet I see plain enough that I have raised your Curiosity; and therefore, from the same Motive, that I slightly mentioned it at all in my last Letter, I will, in this, give you a full and very circumstantial Account of the whole Affair.</p><p>But, before I begin, I must first set you right in one very material Point, in which I have missled you, as to the true Cuase of all this Uproar amongst us; - which does not take its Rise, as I then told you, from the Affair of the Breeches; but, on the contrary, the whole Affair of the Breeches has taken its Rise from it: - To understand which, you must know, that the first Beginning of the Squabble was not between John the Parish-Clerk and Trim the Sexton, but betwixt the Parson of the Parish and said Master Trim,</p>
                        <pb n="3">
                            <p>about an old Watch-Coat, which had many Years hung up in the Church, which Trim had set his Heart upon; and nothing would serve Trim but he must take it home, in order to have it converted into a warm Under-Petticoat for his Wife, and a Jerkin for himself, against Winter; which, in a plaintive Tone, he most humbly begg'd his Reverence would consent to.</p> <p>I need not tell you, Sir, who have so often felt it, that a Principle of strong Compassion transports a generous Mind sometimes beyond what is strictly right, - the Parson was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of this very Crime; - for no sooner did the distinct Words - Petticoat - poor Wife - warm - Winter strike upon his Ear, - but his Heart warmed, - and, before Trim had well got to the End of his Petition, (being a Gentleman of a frank and open Temper) he told him he was welocme to it, with all his Heart and Soul. But, Trim, says he, as you see I am but just got down to my Living, and am an utter Stranger to all Parish-Matters, know nothing about this old Watch-Coat you beg of me, having never seen it in my</p>
                            <pb n="4">
                                <p>Life, and therefore cannot be a Judge whether 'tis fit for such a Purpose; or, if it is, in Truth, know not whether 'tis mine to bestow upon you or not; - you must have a Week or ten Days Patience, till I can make some Inquiries about it; - and, if I find it is in my Power, I tell you again, Man, your Wife is heartily welcome to an Under-Petticoat out of it, and you to a Jerkin, was the Thing as good again as you represent it.</p><p>It is necessary to inform you, Sir, in this Place, That the Parson was earnestly bent to serve Trim in this Affair, not only from the Motive of Generosity, which I have justly ascribed to him, but likewise from another Motive; and that was by way of making some Sort of Recompence for a Multitude of small Services which Trim had occasionally done, and indeed was continually doing, (as he was much about the House) when his own Man was out of the Way. For all these Reasons together, I say, the Parson of the Parish intended to serve Ttrim in this Matter to the utmost of his Power: All that was wanting was previously to inquire, if any one</p>
                            <pb n="5">
                                <p>had a Claim to it; - or whether, as it had, Time immemorial, hung up in the Church, the taking it down might not raise a Clamour in the Parish. These Inquiries were the very Thing that Trim dreaded in his Heart. - He knew very well that if the Parson should but say one Word to the Church-Wardens about it, there would be an End of the whole Affair. For this, and some other Reasons not necessary to be told you, at present, Trim was for allowing no Time in this Matter; - but, on the contrary, doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the Vicarage-House; - plagued the whole Family to Death; - pressed his Suit Morning, Noon, and Night; and, to shorten my Story, teazed the poor Gentleman, who was but in an ill State of Health, almost out of his Life about it.</p><p>You will not wonder, when I tell you, that all this Hurry and Precipitation, on the Side of Master Trim, produced its natural Effect on the Side of the Parson, and that was, a Suspicion that all was not right at the Bottom.</p>
                            <pb n="6">
                                <p>He was one Evening sitting alone in his Study, weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind; and, after an Hour and a half's serious Deliberation upon the Affair, and running over Trim's Behaviour throughout, - he was just saying to himself, It must be so; - when a sudden Rap at the Door put an End to his Soliloquy, - and, in a few Minutes, to his Doubts too; for a Labourer in teh Town, who deem'd himself past his fifty-second Year, had been returned by the Constable in the Militia-List, - and he had come, with a Groat in his Hand, to search the Parish Register for his Age. - The Parson bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket, and go into the Kitchen: - Then shitting the Study Door, and taking down the Parish Register, - Who knwos, says he, but I may find something here about this self-same Watch-Coat? - He had scarce unclasped the Book, in saying this, when he popp'd upon the very Thing he wanted, fairly wrote on the first Page, pasted to the Inside of one of the Covers, whereon was a Memorandum about the very Thing in Question, in these express Words:</p> 
                            <pb n="7">
                                <p>The great Watch-Coat was purchased and given above two hundred Years ago, by the Lord of the Manor, to this Parish-Church, to the sole Use and Behoof of the poor Sertons thereof, and their Successors, for ever, to be worn by them respectively in winterly cold Nights, in ringing Complines, Passing-Bells,"&amp;"c. which the said Lord of the Manor had done, in Piety, to keep the poor Wretches warm, and for the Good of his own Soul, for which they were directed to pray, "&amp;"c."&amp;"c."&amp;"c."&amp;"c. Just Heaven! said the Parson to himself, looking upwards, What an Escape have I had! Give this for an Under-Petticoat to Trim's Wife! I would not have consented to such a Desecration to be Primate of all England; nay, I would not have disturb'd a single Button of it for half my Tythes!</p> <p>Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when in pops Trim with the whole Subject of the Exclamation under both his Arms. - I say, under both his Arms; - for he had actually got it ripp'd and cut out ready, his own Jerkin under one Arm, and the Petticoat under the other, in order to be carried to the Taylor to be made up, -</p>

Ho! Hollo!

He acquainted the Club, That Mr.President was altogether wrong in every Supposition he had made, except that one, where the Great Watch-Coat was said by him to represent Europe, or at least a great Part of it: - So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our History to come at the Truth. He then acquainted them, that the dividing the Great Watch-Coat did, and could, allude to nothing else in the World but the Partition-Treaty; which, by the Bye, he told them, was the most unhappy and scandalous Transaction in all King William's Life: It was that false Step, and that only, says he, rising from his Chair, and striking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence; it was that false Step, says he, knitting his Brows</p>

"&amp;"c. - Now we all know, continued he, that King George the First made a Promise of that important Pass to the King of Spain: - So that the whole Drift of the Romance, according to my Sense of Things, is merely to vindicate the King and Parliament in that Transaction, which made so much Noise in the World.</p> <p>A Wholesale Taylor, who from the Beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the Debate, - was at last drawn into it, by something very unexpected in the last Person's Argument.</p> <p>He told the Company, frankly, he did not understand what Ichnography meant: - But as for the Shape of a Pair of Breeches, as he had had the Advantage of cutting out so many hundred Pairs in his</p>

But, hold, - Close to the Fire, and opposite to where the Apothecary sat, there sat also a Gentleman of the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Cause, seem'd no way satisfied in his Conscience with any one Proceeding in it. This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their several Evidences on the other Side; - reserving himself, like an expert Practitioner, for the last Word in the Debate.
