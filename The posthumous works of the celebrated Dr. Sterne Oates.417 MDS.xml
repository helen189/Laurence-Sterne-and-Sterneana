             <p>of a particular chapter, and expressed himself thus: - "Swift said, that if there were but a dozen Arbuthnots in the world, he would burn his Gulliver. - In like manner," added he, "I declare, that if there were only as many Charlemonts in these kingdoms, I would also commit my Primmer * to the flames."</p> <p>So honourable a testimony as this, sufficiently justifies the preference with which I subscribe myself, on this occasion, your lordship's</p> <p>Most humble</p> <p>and obedient servant,</p> <p>THE EDITOR.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* This article will unfold itself in due time.</p>

             <p>THE</p> <p>EDITOR</p> <p>TO THE READER.</p> <p>I HERE present the public with the remains of an author, who has long entertained and amused them, and who has been the subject both of applause and censure - himself equally regardless of both. - He was a second Democritus, who sported his opinions freely, just as his philosophy, or his fancy led the way: and as he instilled no profligate principle, nor solicited any loose desire, the worst that could possibly be said, of the very worst part of his writings, might be only, that they were as indecent, but as innocent, at the same time, as the sprawling of an infant on the floor.</p>
            <pb n="1:vi" xml:id="pb-1:vi" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>And I shall give you here his own sentiments about this matter, which I have taken, ex ore suo, from one of the following pages - </p> <p>"And I, who am myself a perfect philosopher of the French school, whose motto is ride, si sapis,<note>Latin</note> do affirm, that writings which divert or exhilarate the mind, though ever so arch or free, provided they appear to have no other scope, ought not to be reprehended with too methodistical a severity - while those, indeed, cannot be too loudly anathematized, which aim directly, or even with the most remote obliquity, against any one principle of honour, morals, or religion *."</p> <p>These notes were designed by the author, to frame a larger work from</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* See p. 45.</p>

             <p>than the present, to be published after he should find himself - or the public - tired of the sportive incoherence of his former volumes. - But his untimely and unexpected death prevented him from digesting and completing this scheme.</p> <p>These sheets had been put into my hands, some time before this unhappy event, to correct or cancel, as I should think proper; and he left them with me, on his death-bed, to dispose of after what manner I might choose - either to be kept among my miscellaneous papers, for my own amusement, or published to the world, or thrown into the fire. - His expression to me, upon that affecting occasion, was equally elegant and flattering. - </p> <note>Latin</note> <p>Et dixit moriens - Te nunc habet ista secundum. - </p>

             <p>I imagined that any tract of this author, especially into which he transfuses so much of his very soul, might afford some entertainment to the public; and I have, therefore, committed these incorrect pieces, and unfinished sketches, to the press, without attempting to make any manner of addition, or alteration in them, except the leaving out of some passages, that were either unintelligible - or too plain.</p> <p>And if there should yet appear to have remained some other particulars, which the scrupulous reader may think to have needed the further use of the stile, I am very certain that he will meet with sufficient matter, in the rest of the work, to make the author's apology, and to serve also as a justification of</p> <p>THE EDITOR.</p>

             <p>A</p> <p>PRIVATE LETTER</p> <p>FROM</p> <p>THE AUTHOR TO THE EDITOR.</p> <p>TO ONE IN A MILLION.</p> <p>My very good Friend,</p> <p>I AM just returned from hunting o'er the hills, and far away; and as my manner has ever been, whether riding, walking, skateing, swimming, or boating - and I dare venture to hold a wager, that it would be the same if I was flying - to revolve those subjects in my mind, which I purpose, at any time of my</p>
            <pb n="1:2" xml:id="pb-1:2" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>life, to discuss in writing, your request to me lately has occupied my whole thoughts all this morning. - <note>Latin</note>Experieris non Dianam magis in montibus, quÃ m Minervam inerrare, as Pliny says.</p> <p>In such a memoiring and memorable age as this, whu not write my own Memoirs? vexatus toties. I have gone through a multitude of novels, within these few years past, and have attended, with most exemplary patience and perseverance, chapter after chapter, in hope that the next anecdote might possibly make me some amends for the dulness of the former. In vain! Modern novelists seem to be deficient, even in invention. - We</p>
            <pb n="1:3" xml:id="pb-1:3" facs="#i21"/>
             <p>forgive them their total want of language, stile, moral, character, or sentiment.</p> <p>My series of life has happily saved me the intire labour of conception. For the mere literal narrative of my adventures, from the moment I was uncased from my first envelope, till the instant I shall escape from this second caul - for the context and complexion of my past life will probably form the weft and hue of my future - would amuse and interest my readers, though recited in the simplicity of my nurse, the stupidity of my pedagogues, or the tediousness of modern memoirists; who may be said, according to Aristotle's figure, stiled Paronomasia, to write more pour</p>
            <pb n="1:4" xml:id="pb-1:4" facs="#i22"/>
             <p>Faim, than Fame. - For I take Necessity to be a muse that's fairly worth the nine, and literary Fame to be lineally derived from Fames.</p> <p>Largitor ingenii venter. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>Pray don't be alarmed at the word Koran, which I have chosen to make the title of these papers. I am not turned Mussulman; but I hate appropriated names, because they restrain the language too much, and are apt to lead to superstition. - And I see no reason why my visions and vagaries have not as good a right to be called Al Koran, or The Koran, as the inventions and impositions of Mahomet; which were stiled so, merely as being a collection of chapters - for so the word in Arabic signifies.</p> <p>But to proceed - </p>

             <p>THE KORAN.</p> <p>CHAP. I.</p> <p>THE CHANCE-MEDLEY.</p> <p>AS I am, at length and long-run, safely delivered into the world, and fairly entered into life, I think it high time now to give you some account of myself - so often promised, and so long delayed - which I shall do, in as few words as the nature of the subject, and the writer</p>
            <pb n="1:6" xml:id="pb-1:6" facs="#i24"/>
             <p>of it, will permit. Hic vir, hic est, tibi quem promitti saepiÃ¹s audis.<note>Latin</note></p> <p>I was really born - no doubt on't: for if I had not, I should never have pretended to say so - But first let me account for myself, in the character I at present stand before you, as an author - which I never intended - nor indeed was ever intended - to be. - I happened to become one by mere chance.</p> <p>Chance has ever been my fate. My father never designed me any manner of education. He was a brave soldier, and despised it. What a power of courage he must have had! So I learned to read and write, by chance. I</p>
            <pb n="1:7" xml:id="pb-1:7" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>miched once to school, and picked up a little literature, by chance. I never meant to marry, and yet it was my luck to get a wife. I never had any patron, but was provided for by fortune.</p> <p>Chance, Luck, and Fortune then have been my Clotho, Atropos, and Lachesis - and so I have assumed the cognomen of Tria juncta in uno - <note>Latin</note> which is another chance also; as I never once thought of such a derivation, before this very instant.</p> <p>But how an author by chance, prithee? - I'll tell you, if you'll have but a little patience.</p>
            <pb n="1:8" xml:id="pb-1:8" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>CHAP. II.</p> <p>THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS.</p> <p>THIS method of dividing a subject into chapters, is an admirable expedient for your pennyworth wits, and your two-penny readers. It serves as resting pauses to both.</p> <note>Latin</note> <p>Divisum sic breve siet opus.</p> <p>The Bible itself might, perhaps, to some appear tedious, if it was not for the comfortable relief of chapters.</p>
            <pb n="1:9" xml:id="pb-1:9" facs="#i27"/>
             <p>Besides, the intervals, or white lines, as the printers stile them, help to swell the volume like a bladder; or may be compared to an article of potted saw-dust in a bill of fare, which helps to cover a table, though it adds nothing to the feast.</p> <p>Here now I expect that my old acquaintance the UN-critical Reviewers will be apt to remark upon this passage, that these spaces are the most valuable parts of my books, as a blank is better than a blot at any time, with other insipidities of the same sort.</p> <p>But let them prate; for I have long since brought myself to be very</p>
            <pb n="1:10" xml:id="pb-1:10" facs="#i28"/>
             <p>well able to bear with them, by becoming regardless equally of their applause or censure. True critics, like hawks, hunt for pleasure: but the Reviewers, like vultures, only for prey.</p> <p>And for this reason, I don't think one should be too severe against the poor devils neither. They ought rather to become the object of our pity than resentment, who, like hang-men, are obliged to execute for bread. And it should therefore be a considerable advantage to a work, to have received their censure - for an author may set what price he pleases on a book that has been condemned to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman.</p>
            <pb n="1:11" xml:id="pb-1:11" facs="#i29"/>
             <p>CHAP. III.</p> <p>THE UNCLE.</p> <p>I THINK I promised, in my first chapter, to give you my authority in literature. Thus it was - </p> <p>I happened to have an uncle once, who was a minister of the gospel, but his only study was politics. He had a laudable ambition to rise in life. Religion is undoubtedly a necessary qualification for that purpose in the next world - but is not sufficient to help us forward in this.</p>
            <pb n="1:12" xml:id="pb-1:12" facs="#i30"/>
             <p>He took care, therefore, just to get the thirty-nine articles by heart, to enable him to stand an examination of faith on the day of judgment - not attending to the good old saying, Live and learn, die and forget all: but his maxims were, not to go, while you stay - to live whilst you live; for at the hour of death, sufficient to that day will be the evil thereof.</p> <p>In prosecution then of his scheme of life, he wrote and published several party papers, during the reign of Sir Robert Walpole, in favour of his ministry - but Mammon left him in the lurch. - They produced no effect toward his advancement. - They were poorly written. - Parsons generally</p>
            <pb n="1:13" xml:id="pb-1:13" facs="#i31"/>
             <p>write ill, even upon their own subjects.</p> <p>He might better have employed himself, in saying his prayers - for, in this service, whatever is well meant, is well received, though ever so ill performed: but in the other case, whatever is well executed only, is well accepted of, however ill intended. - This mortified our divine.</p> <p>Just at this crisis I happened to return into the country; after having quitted college, and brought home some little character from the university, for parts and learning. - </p>
            <pb n="1:14" xml:id="pb-1:14" facs="#i32"/>
             <p>But I am hurrying the reader on too fast. My stock is small, and needs oeconomy. So I think that I have now wrote enough for this chapter - and, in the stile of a sermon, I shall leave you to consider of what has been said, and defer the remainder to another opportunity.</p>
            <pb n="1:15" xml:id="pb-1:15" facs="#i33"/>
             <p>CHAP IV.</p> <p>ON MURDER.</p> <p>FOR my own part, I have not the least notion how any man - or woman either - can bring themselves to commit murder - except indeed it happened to be on the body of a brother, a friend, a mistress, or some other such fond and dear connections as these.</p> <p>Human nature revolts at the very idea; insomuch that I know not what temptation can induce any person to be guilt of such a crime - </p>
            <pb n="1:16" xml:id="pb-1:16" facs="#i34"/>
             <p>for temptation comes from nature, whose strongest propensity is the very reverse of it. - This vice then must certainly arise from provocation only - because provocation proceeds from the devil.</p> <p>Thus, reader, you may perceive - that is, supposing you to have been attentive to what I am saying all this while, that I have here made a nice distinction of it, between the flesh and the devil. - Pray now, please you to observe the consequence.</p> <p>The provocation then must be of the highest kind. - This cannot arise from any indifferent person. They can never provoke us sufficiently. - A man - </p>
            <pb n="1:17" xml:id="pb-1:17" facs="#i35"/>
             <p>or woman either - deserves to be hanged for killing such as these. - No - A brother, a friend, a child, a wife, or a mistress, must therefore become the proper objects of our most deadly resentment. Ergo - </p> <p>The application of this argument in some other chapter.</p>
            <pb n="1:18" xml:id="pb-1:18" facs="#i36"/>
             <p>CHAP. V.</p> <p>THE MINISTERIAL WRITER.</p> <p>MY uncle then employed me to write a pamphlet, in defence of the ministry - not of the gospel. I obeyed his commands, and put the manuscript into his hands; which he carried forthwith in his own name to Sir Robert.</p> <p>He approved of it; 'twas sent to the press, and procured the parson preferment - but prevented his own - for it kept the knight out of the House</p>
            <pb n="1:19" xml:id="pb-1:19" facs="#i37"/>
             <p>of Lords for the remainder of that septennial.</p> <p>The method I used in that pamphlet was this - I collected together every thing that had been ever objected against the minister, from his first entering into office till that time, and ipse dixited <note>Latin</note>every article of it, point blanc, in the negative - from my own certain knowledge, and other sufficient authority - Affirmed myself to be no courtier, nor even acquainted with one; but to be a mere country gentleman, of an independent fortune, who had never before troubled his head about party disputes, vulgarly stiled politics - but, shocked at the licentiousness of the times, had entered a volunteer</p>
            <pb n="1:20" xml:id="pb-1:20" facs="#i38"/>
             <p>in the service of my king, my country, and the support of ministerial virtue and integrity.</p> <p>I affirmed, that the high price of provisions, so loudly complained of, arose from the riches and affluence flowing daily into the kingdom, under the auspices of our minister - and that the accumulation of taxes, like the rising of rents, was the surest token of a nation's thriving - that the dearness of markets, with these new imposts of government, necessarily doubled industry - and that an increase of this natural kind of manufacture, was adding to the capital stock of the commonwealth.</p>

             <p>I lamented the fatal effects to be apprehended from all these heats, animosities, and revilings, which I said I had good reason to affirm were but a method of acting and instilling treason, under cover - for that whenever the minister was abused, the king was attacked.</p> <p>So profligate parsons, whenever they fall into detestation or contempt, inveigh against the impiety of the times, and charge the scandal and reproach they have themselves induced upon their function, to the atheism of the laity.</p> <p>This book of mine has been the codex, or ars politica, of all the ministerial</p>

             <p>CHAP. VI.</p> <p>ORIGIN OF UNCLE TOBY.</p> <p>THE income of my uncle's new benefice was considerable; and I thought that I had some claim to part of the emoluments of it. I was amused with hope for several years; during which time he contrived to get some other useful jobs out of me - But my good uncle was a courtier, as I told you before - He promised, and performed, like one.</p> <p>This disappointment, this ingratitude, provoked my resentment to the</p>
            <pb n="1:24" xml:id="pb-1:24" facs="#i42"/>
             <p>highest degree. - Here read the penultima chapter over again, and I'll wait for you.</p> <p> - <note>48 dashes</note></p> <p>However, this incident happened afterwards to turn out a good deal to my own advantage. - If I can help others to live by my wits, said I to myself, one day that I happened to be in a reasoning mood, what a fool must I be, not to endeavour to manufacture them a little toward my own profit?</p>
            <pb n="1:25" xml:id="pb-1:25" facs="#i43"/>
             <p>I had been just then priested - I wrote a sermon, preached and published it - But I hate to tell a story twice, as much as others do to hear one.</p> <p>I then formed the design of writing my own memoirs - Why not? Every French ensign does the same. If we are not of sufficient consequence to the world, we certainly are so to ourselves. We feel our own self-importance - and how natural is it to express one's feelings!</p> <p>In order to embellish this work, I drew a sketch of my uncle's character. - It was bitter enough, to say the truth of it - for truth it was - </p>
            <pb n="1:26" xml:id="pb-1:26" facs="#i44"/>
             <p>But happening to shew this trait to some of my friends, they reprehended me for it. - Parsons, said they, God knows, have enemies enough already - they need not slander one another.</p> <p>No man brooks chiding better - nor can I long harbour resentment. - I have no inimicality in my nature - my blood is milk, and curdles at another's woe - I had forgiven the man long before; and it was more out of humour, than malice, that I had been tempted, not provoked, to introduce him on the scene.</p> <p>I immediately changed my purpose. - But as this defalcation had</p>
            <pb n="1:27" xml:id="pb-1:27" facs="#i45"/>
             <p>left an hiatus deflendus <note>Latin</note> in my piece - for they are all but pieces - I supplied the chasm of this dramatis personae, by an imaginary Uncle Toby, already sufficiently known to the world. - </p> <p>Many years before this latter aera, I happened to fall into matrimony - Sed chartae silent - The modest reader, and I desire no other, will surely suffer me to draw the curtain here. - And so finishes the sixth chapter.</p>

             <p>CHAP. VII.</p> <p>LE FEVRE.</p> <p>AND now it is full time to commence a new one. - But I am again precipitating matters and things too hastily - I was always giddy - The reader must have time allowed him for digestion - Let us take up my story a little higher.</p> <p>My father was an Englishman, and had a command in the army - He was stationed in Ireland at the time of my birth, which happened - I forget</p>
            <pb n="1:29" xml:id="pb-1:29" facs="#i47"/>
             <p>what year - in the city of Clonmel. - I remained in that kingdom till I was about twelve years old - and there I received the first rudiments of literature, from the kindness and humanity of a lieutenant, who was in the same corps with my father - His name was Le Fevre.</p> <p>But indeed I owe infinitely more to him than my Latin grammar. It was he that taught me the Grammar of Virtue - It was this most excellent person who first instilled into my mind the principles - not of a Parson - but of a Divine - It was he who imbued my soul with humanity, benevolence, and charity - It was he</p>
            <pb n="1:30" xml:id="pb-1:30" facs="#i48"/>
             <p>who inspired me with that vibration for the distresses of mankind,</p> <p>"Which, like the needle true,</p> <p>Turns at the touch of others woe,</p> <p>And turning trembles too *."</p> <p> - It was he who instructed me that temperance is the best source of charity. - 'Tis in this sense only that it should ever be said to begin at home - Readers, throw your gouts, your cholics, your scurvies, to the poor.</p> <p> - It was he who furnished me with this admirable hint to charity - that the more a person wants, the less will do him good. - It was he who softened my</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Mrs. Greville's Ode.</p>

             <p>nature to that tender sensibility, and fond sympathy, which have created the principal pains and pleasures of my life; and which will, I trust in God, insure the latter, in the next, without its alloy. - Amen!</p> <p>This good man has been long dead; and in grateful honour of his memory, I have mentioned his name in another place - 'Twas all I could! - I would have plucked a nettle from his grave, had I seen one ever grow there - For surely there was nothing, either in the humors of his body, or the temperament of his mind, that such a noli me tangere <note>Latin</note> weed could be nourished by, or emblematic of - - </p>

             <p>CHAP. VIII.</p> <p>A DIGRESSION ON WIT.</p> <p>WHAT is wit? - 'Tis not a manufacture - It is not to be wrought out of the mind, by dint of study and labour, as sense, reason, and science are - Ideas, with the very words fitted to them, ready cut and dry, come bounce all complete together into the brain, without the least manner of reflection.</p> <p>Even I have sometimes said things without design, unconscious of any</p>
            <pb n="1:33" xml:id="pb-1:33" facs="#i51"/>
             <p>kind of wit in them myself, till the sound of the words has alarmed my own ears, or made others to prick up theirs. If wit had been hanging matter - and so it might, for any great harm it would do - I should then have incurred the penalty of a sort of chance-medley treason. It would have required time and thought to have expressed myself worse - or according to law - upon such occasions.</p> <p>What is the reason, that between two persons, of equal sense and learning, an imagery shall generally strike the one, and never the other? - That upon viewing a green field, stocked with new shorn sheep, one man shall</p>
            <pb n="1:34" xml:id="pb-1:34" facs="#i52"/>
             <p>see nothing there, but grass and mutton, and that another shall resemble it to a tansey, stuck with almonds?</p> <p>That one person shall plainly say, of a fine day in winter, that the sun shines, but does not warm - while another shall, at the same instant, compare it to a jewel, at once both bright and cold? &amp;c.</p> <p>Thus you see that wit is only a double-entendre. - What pity 'tis, ladies, that double-entendres are not always wit also - </p> <p>Nay, the prudish Cowley has, unluckily for us, made them one of the negative definitions of it:</p>
            <pb n="1:35" xml:id="pb-1:35" facs="#i53"/>
             <p>"Much less can that have any place,</p> <p>At which a virgin hides her face - </p> <p>Such dross the fire must purge away. 'Tis just</p> <p>The writer blush, where'er the reader must."</p>

             <p>CHAP. IX.</p> <p>WHETHER I MYSELF HAVE WIT.</p> <p>THIS point has been questioned by some - One Biographer, Triglyph, calls me an anomalous, heteroclite writer - words, by the bye, that signify the same thing - says, that I have more sauce than pig *, &amp;c. - They allow me oddness, originality, and humour - but deny me wit.</p> <p>If by this expression they mean epigrammatic point, perhaps I may</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* The Triumvirate, the preface.</p>
            <pb n="1:37" xml:id="pb-1:37" facs="#i55"/>
             <p>have but little of it. - But let wit be sauce, according to good Master Triglyph. - Must sauces always be poignant? - Is not that esteemed the best cookery, where the ingredients are so equally blended, that no one particular flavour predominates upon the palate? - Decayed appetites only require the sharper seasonings.</p> <p>They grant me humour, originality, and description. - What then is wit, if these articles do not comprehend it? - And if it is any thing else, how little necessary must it be, where these already are?</p> <p>The ancients stiled wit ingenium - capacity, invention, powers. - Martial</p>
            <pb n="1:38" xml:id="pb-1:38" facs="#i56"/>
             <p>was the first person who reduced it to a point - and too many of the writings, since the aera of the faux brilliants, have been so very eager, that they have almost set one's teeth on edge.</p> <p>So far am I easy on this score, whether they allow me wit, or no.</p>

             <p>CHAP. X.</p> <p>OF WIT, IN MORALS.</p> <p>I Formerly used to prefer Pliny's Epistles, and Seneca's Morals, before Cicero's writings of both kinds - because of the points of wit, and quaint turns, in the former. - I remember when I thought Horace and Catullus flat and insipid - but then it was when I admired Martial and Cowley.</p> <p>Plain meats, simply dressed, are certainly more wholesome food, than</p>
            <pb n="1:40" xml:id="pb-1:40" facs="#i58"/>
             <p>higher cooked repasts. - But one who has indulged, or rather depraved, his appetite, with the latter viands, cannot, without difficulty, recover his natural relish for the former. - We are just in the same circumstances in literature.</p> <p>The sport of fancy, and a play of words, may have, perhaps, this effect, to fix the sentiment more strongly in the mind - but I seldom found that they carried their uses further - </p> <p>Play round the head, but enter not the heart.</p> <p>Strong phrases, and opposition of terms, may store the common place of</p>
            <pb n="1:41" xml:id="pb-1:41" facs="#i59"/>
             <p>memory with apt sentiments, which may help a person to shine, in writing, or conversation: but this wants the true splendor of learning, the temperato usu; while sound sense and reason, more plainly expressed, operates upon us in the nature of an alterative medicine - slow, but sure.</p> <p>And though by degrees we bound, with vigour not our own; yet not being able directly to impute our strength to any foreign assistance, we are apt to cherish that sense and virtue, which we by this means acquire, as we do the heirs of our own loins - while those acquisitions we make, by the help of remembred wit only, are received into the heart as coldly as an adoption.</p>
            <pb n="1:42" xml:id="pb-1:42" facs="#i60"/>
             <p>I find myself moralizing here, somewhat in the very stile I have been reprehending - but I have not restrained my pen - for when we condemn a fault - to carry on the vein - we should endeavour to make an example of it. - And it may be applied to me, what was said of Jeremy, in Love for Love, "that he was declaiming against wit, with all the wit he could muster."</p> <p>But witty I am henceforth resolved to be for the rest of my life. - Lord, Sir, resolution is a powerful thing; it has rendered many a coward brave, and a few women chaste. - Let us try now whether this same miraculous faculty cannot make one parson witty - for a wonder.</p>

             <p>CHAP. XI.</p> <p>TRIGLYPH AND TRISTRAM COMPARED.</p> <p>BUT the author of the Triumvirate is still more severe on me, on account of some free passages in my works. - Call them not my works, but my sports only - and please to let Master Triglyph know, that I was not writing treatises on morals, or lectures on religion, at that time - I wrote intirely for the benefit of my own health, and that of my readers also.</p>
            <pb n="1:44" xml:id="pb-1:44" facs="#i62"/>
             <p>Bacon, in his historia vitae &amp; mortis, recommends chearful and light writings to be read, for life and death - and I will actually get them inserted among the materia medica, in the next edition of the London Dispensatory. - Why should we find fault with the archness of any passage, that contributes towards so salutary a purpose? What freedoms are not surgeons obliged often to use, particularly in obstetricks - for the health or safety of the chastest maid or matron?</p> <p>Some other philosopher recommends hae nugae too for the relief of the mind - </p> <note>Latin</note> <p> - Lusus animo debent aliquando dari,</p> <p>Ad cogitandum melior ut redeat sibi.</p>
            <pb n="1:45" xml:id="pb-1:45" facs="#i63"/>
             <p>And I, who am myself a perfect philosopher of the French school, whose motto is, ride, si sapis, <note>Latin</note> do affirm, that writings which divert or exhilarate the mind, though ever so arch or free, provided they appear to have no other scope, ought not to be reprehended with too methodistical a severity - while those indeed cannot be too loudly anathematized, which aim directly, or even with the most remote obliquity, against any one principle of honour, morals, or religion.</p> <p>But prithee, ladies, is not Triglyph full as arch and free as Tristram? I shall not take the pains to collate the several passages together - nor, like</p>

             <p>friend Kidgel, reveal, while I expose. - But is not his LXXXVIIIth chapter un chef d'oeuvre in this way?</p> <p>He therein mentions the accidental view of a fine woman, stark naked - Indeed he neither describes her person, her limbs, her complexion, nor makes use of any one loose idea, or indecent expression - Better he had - for then the offence would have ended there - But how is the reader's imagination inflamed, and his passions emoved, by sympathy, with those effects which the spectator tells you this object had upon his own senses and sensations?</p> <p>To be able thus to raise a smile, without a blush, and to provoke desire,</p>

             <p>without offending decency, is an art, good Master Triglyph, that is capable of uncalendering a saint.</p> <p>Sedley has that prevailing gentle art, &amp;c.</p> <p>But I do not deny the man his merits, as he has also had the candor not to refuse me mine - for, though we are both great rivals, it is in a sentiment that ought to make us the greater friends. - We seem equally to wish, and most fervently pray, for "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men." Amen!</p> <p>But to proceed - </p>

             <p>CHAP. XII.</p> <p>THE ABIGAIL.</p> <p>WHEN I was about twelve years old, as I told you before, my father and mother returned into England, and brought me over with them: I was then placed at a regular school - at my own most earnest instance, threatening, if refused, to inlist myself among the strolling gypsies, to purchase any knowledge, at any rate - From whence I was, in due time, transferred to the university.</p>
            <pb n="1:49" xml:id="pb-1:49" facs="#i67"/>
             <p>I need not trouble you here with a particular account of my education - the benefits of it are sufficiently apparent in my writings - Let your works, not your words, prove you, says somebody - if not, I say so myself. So that my life is all that the reader has any right to call upon me for here.</p> <p>In that large field then I was first entered by my mother's maid. - This was no slip of mine - the back-sliding was all her own - Alas! what wit had I? - And for this faux pas it is needless to make any manner of apology - Men must be initiated in the mysteries of iniquity, in order the more safely to pursue the paths of virtue - </p>
            <pb n="1:50" xml:id="pb-1:50" facs="#i68"/>
             <p>And if you will not take my word for it, because I am a christian, listen to what Terence, who was a notorious heathen, says upon this subject:</p> <note>Latin</note> <p>Id verÃ² est, quod ego mihi puto palmarium,</p> <p>Me reperisse quomodo adolescentulus</p> <p>Meretricum ingenia, et mores, posset noscere,</p> <p>MaturÃ¨ ut cÃ¹m cognorit, perpetuÃ² oderit.</p> <p>EUN.</p> <p>I happened to marry, sometime after, and communicated my experience to my wife - she nothing loath, &amp;c.</p> <p>It would, I think, be highly improper in me to add one sentence more to such a chapter as this.</p>
            <pb n="1:51" xml:id="pb-1:51" facs="#i69"/>
             <p>CHAP XIII.</p> <p>ON LITERAL MODESTY.</p> <p>AS the world seems not to be charitably enough inclined to give me credit for the merit of the above title, it forces me here to break through the very rules of it, in order to point out those instances where I happen to afford any rare specimen of my bien-seance.</p> <p>The close of my last chapter is a remarkable example of this kind. - With what a becoming decency did</p>
            <pb n="1:52" xml:id="pb-1:52" facs="#i70"/>
             <p>I drop the curtain, in that scene! According to the rule of Horace,</p> <note>Latin</note> <p> - Non tamen intÃ¹s</p> <p>Digna geri, promes in scenam. - </p> <p>And yet I have read Meursius, Ausonius, and Martinus Scriblerus, I assure you - which I think I may confess, the more freely, as you may perceive that I am not a bit the worse for such dangerous precedents.</p> <p>A word by the bye. - Precedents are the bane and disgrace of legislature. - They are not wanted, to justify right measures, and are absolutely insufficient, to excuse wrong ones. - They can only be useful to heralds, dancing-masters, and gentlemen</p>
            <pb n="1:53" xml:id="pb-1:53" facs="#i71"/>
             <p>ushers - because, in these departments, neither reason, virtue, nor the salus pouli, or suprema lex, <note>Latin</note> can have any operation.</p><p>Another instance of my reticence is, that though I brought Terence upon the carpet, I did not quote that passage from him, where he has the impudence to say,</p> <p>Non est stagitium, crede mihi, adolescentulum Scortari, neque potare. ADELPH.</p> <p>Which, though, in reality, not spoken in the mere dictionary sense of the words, might have, however, been made a sinister use of, had I had any of that profligate turn of mind, that has, sometimes, been so unfairly imputed to me.</p>
            <pb n="1:54" xml:id="pb-1:54" facs="#i72"/>
            <p>I love a joke; I don't deny it - and whether 'tis a black or a white one, I own that I do not always wait to examine. But what does this signify? Abler persons than I often taken things in the lump - and provided we are but pleased, methinks it is being rather more nice than wise to consider through what medium. But then I think it no joke, to debauch or corrupt another person's mind or principles. - Charge this upon me who can.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XIV.</p> <p>ON LIBERAL MODESTY.</p> <p>DO you comprehend the distinction of this title? for I am no definitioner.</p> <note>Greek</note> <p>ÎÎ¹Î´ÏÏ È£Ï° Î¬Î³Î±Î¸Î·, is an expression of Hesiod's. Horace calls it pudor malus, <note>Latin</note> and the French say mauvaise honte. By all which terms, is meant that kind of bashfulness which is observed in young persons of the best parts and merit, on their first entrance into life, or mixing with the world; and which many people are never after able to shake off.</p>
            <pb n="1:56" xml:id="pb-1:56" facs="#i74"/>
            <p>This sort of modesty is said to be highly commendable, and a token of hopeful presage in youth. For my part, I cannot see why. - It is not an advantage to be in possession of all one's faculties? Can a bashful person be so? While a little assurance, like the Tincture of Sage, gives a man the perfect possession of himself*.</p> <p>Can a man, who has a diffidence of his powers, either write, speak, love, or fight, as well as he who reposes a confidence in them? When we would cast a reflection on the character of a soldier, need we use severer terms than to say, he is bashful - he is apt to be embarrassed on the day of battle? &amp;c.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* See Dr. Hill's advertisement.</p>
            <pb n="1:57" xml:id="pb-1:57" facs="#i75"/>
            <p>But were we to investigate this same imputed merit, in the school of philosophy, we should probably find that it has its foundation, not so much in the modesty of others, as in the vanity of ourselves. We naturally accept this awe before us, as a deference to our own superior consequence, and so are first flattered, before we praise.</p> <p>As I am not much given to adulation myself, I never remember to have paid a sneaking compliment of this sort to any one in my life. I have ever sat, walked, or conversed, at prefect ease, among persons of the highest rank or genius - and should be as much ashamed of keeping a reserve</p>

            <p>over whatever little wit or parts I am possessed of, before people of superior talents, as I should be of slinking into a slut's corner of the room, because there happened to be a taller or an handsomer man in company.</p>

You can have no right to expect any extraordinary adventures, or critical situations, in the life of a sickly, home-bred, married, country parson.</p> <p>I have, indeed, had some - say many - connections, with certain</p>

            <p>anecdotes, or private memoirs, relative to others, that would most highly entertain you; and I think I was never in a better humour for telling a story in my life, than I happen to be at this very instant. - But my heart fails me. - Laugh at me as much as you please, and welcome - but I shall never make you merry at the expence of my friends.</p> <p>With regard to myself, I have been ever a thinking - and who would think it? - rather than an active being. My mind indeed has been an Errant-Knight, but my body only a simple Squire - and it has been so harrassed, and chivalried, with the wanderings and the wind-mills of its master, that</p>

            <p>it has long wished to quit the service - frequently crying out, with Sancho, "a blessing on his heart who first invented sleep."</p> <p>However, notwithstanding the natural indolence of this same body of me, I have contrived to fulfil, completely, all the characteristics of man - Which some philosopher specisies to be these four - </p> <p>To build an hour -</p> <p>To raise a tree - </p> <p>To write a book - </p> <p>And</p> <p>To get a child. - </p> <p>These four cardinal virtues then, have I, already, most religiously performed - </p>

XVI.</p> <p>A LETTER.</p> <p>MADAM,</p> <p>I CAN easily perceive how much you were disappointed upon the close of my last chapter. - You had reason, I confess, to have expected something more arch from me upon that subject, than I have there treated you withal.</p> <note>Latin</note> <p>Quid tibi vis, mulier?</p> <p>But I never pimp for others - and I happened not to be in a humour for</p>

            <p>a joke of any colour myself in that section. - I have laboured under a severe fit of cholic and asthma for some time past. - This is a great reformer of manners. - </p> <p>Nay, so far have I carried my literal modesty in that chapter, that where I speak of the four characteristics of mankind, I comprehend them all under the philosophical term of Creation - without distinguishing the latter article, as I might very fairly have done, by the mechanical technic of Pro-creation. - No - in that passage you see I have kept quite clear of Pro and Con.</p> <p>And again - where I come to mention this last manoeuvre, I only make</p>

            <p>CHAP. XVII.</p> <p>THE LAPSUS LINGUAE.</p> <p>BUT in general I am not quite so guarded - I mean with respect to my expressions only: - For words sometimes escape me, without corresponding ideas. - I happen unfortunately to be infected with a certain peculiar phraseology, which, in the hurry of speech, I can rarely command - and this makes me often appear to mean what may be very far from my thoughts at the time.</p>
            <pb n="1:68" xml:id="pb-1:68" facs="#i86"/>
            <p>I have sometimes scolded my servants, and rated my wife and children, with all imaginable seriousness - and when I have been shocked at their appearing to tremble too much, under the terrors of my wrath, think what a mortification it must have been - to a man in a passion - to perceive that their sides were only shaking with laughter, at some odd image, or ridiculous expression, I had struck out, at a heat, unawares.</p> <p>The same cannon ball that took off maresÃ§hal Turenne's head, carried away one of general St. Hilaire's arms. - His son standing by, burst into a passion of grief at his father's misfortune; who reproved him, saying,</p>

            <p>Weep not, my child, for me - but for him.</p> <p>The generous concern, and nobleness of sentiment, with which that brave man must have been affected at that instant, were so powerful over my nerves, that it made my heart move within me, like the sound of a trumpet *.</p> <p>I happened to repeat this story once in company, and it had its effect - till concluding it, with these words - pointing to the nameless corse, â  with the only hand he had left - they</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* So Sir Philip Sidney says of himself, whenever he heard the ballad of Percy and Douglas.</p> <p>â  Sine nomine corpus.

            <p>all fell a-laughing. - I thought them brutes - but quickly recollecting myself, felt ashamed.</p> <p>Explaining the mystery of the redemption once to a young templar, I happened to make an allusion, adapted to his own science, of the levying a fine, and suffering a recovery; this simile was repeated afterwards to my disadvantage; and I was deemed an infidel thenceforward.</p> <p>And why? merely because I am a merry parson, I suppose - for St. Patrick, the Irish patron, because he was a grave one, was canonized for illustrating the Trinity by the comparison of a Shamrock *.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* The Trefoil, or Trois-feuÃ¯lle.</p>

I use no attorney arts to protract a suit; and wish that the Frederic-code was to obtain in literature, as well as in law.</p> <p>You shall certainly meet with subject matter sufficient for your money, in these volumes - but you will find them all under the head, or chapter, of short causes.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XIX.</p> <p>ANOTHER MAN's WIFE.</p> <p>ABOUT a year before I was married, I received the following most extraordinary and interesting letter - </p> <p> - <note>72 short dashes</note></p> <p>See Chapter XV. paragraph 2.</p>

            <p> - <note> 24 short dashes</note></p> <p>But, as I was saying, what business, now-a-days, since the Reformation has expunged the good old practice of confessing out of our Ritual, can a parson have with another man's wife? - To say that she called upon me in her difficulties, and that I relieved her from want, and succoured her in distress - and that these very considerations would have put it absolutely out of my power to have attempted her, had I been ever so much a libertine - availed me not. - The reply was still - that she was another man's wife.</p>

            <p>So that it seems all wives are to be treated like the queens of Spain - who, if they happen to tumble into a ditch, must be suffered to lie, kicking and sprawling there, for life, till their royal consort shall be at leisure, or so disposed, to go and take them out of it.</p> <p>It is death for any subject to lay his prophane finger on her majesty - And as the crown-lawyers have not yet been able to determine in what point of her most sacred person her divinity resides, hands off from every part of her body, has been always deemed the safest measure.</p> <p>One of these miserables of state happened once to be thrown from her</p>

            <p>palfrey, on the pavement of the Escurial. Her royal foot stuck in the stirrup, and she was dragged round the area for a considerable time, her faithful equerry running all the while by her side, his head turned averse, his arm stretched out, and holding his hat between his thumb, index, and middle finger - as dancing-masters teach you on a salute - over her majesty - till king Don was summoned from council, to restore this same majesty to decency again. - She might have lost her life by the ministerial magna charta of precedent.</p> <p>This adventure of mine was the first thing that ever involved me in debt. - I was obliged to borrow two</p>

            <p>hundred pounds, beyond my own currency, upon this occasion. - I had no sufficient security to proffer. - But captain Le Fevre happened luckily, just then, to have sold out of the army - I mortgaged the story to him, and he lent me the money.</p> <p>He was not a man to accept of interest, so I made him a present. He loved reading much. - A collection of ingenious and entertaining papers, stiled The World, happened to be just then collected together, and published, in four volumes. - I sent them to him, with the following lines inscribed. - They were the first rhimes I had ever attempted to tag in my life.</p>

            <p>To Captain Lewis Le Fevre.</p> <p>For one who rashly lent me cash, 'tis fit</p> <p>That I should make a venture too in wit. - </p> <p>In vain I through my pericranium sought:</p> <p>But having heard, that wit is best that's bought,</p> <p>I sent to Dodsley's, for these presents few,</p> <p>To let all men know I am bound to you.</p> <p>Great Sawney wept, that one world was no store - </p> <p>How happier you, who may laugh at four.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XX.</p> <p>EPIGRAM.</p> <p>AFTER this chearful manner have I hitherto passed through life, disappointments, and bad health - but not without suffering many severe strictures on my dissipation and unformality. The lightness of my manners has been reprehended often, though it arises really from the weight of my philosophy. What is there in life that's worth a serious thought? And for the same reason, from having conceived a better opinion of Providence,</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXI.</p> <p>THE GOSPEL FOR THE DAY.</p> <p>SINCE I am in for it, I'll tell you another excommunicable thing I did. - Whether before, or after, I forget. - Is it any matter which?</p> <p>In the city of - , the church was repairing, and the corporation of that town had accommodated the parish with their Tholsel, or town-house, as a chapel of ease, for the time. - There happened to have</p>
            <pb n="1:85" xml:id="pb-1:85" facs="#i103"/>
            <p>been an election for that city not long before. - Upon which mercantile occasion, the worshipful mayor, aldermen, &amp;c. had notoriously - - - - -. - You know how elections are usually carried on, and what admirable securities they are become, of late, for our lives, liberties, and properties!</p> <p>I was among the congregation one Sunday, when the gospel for the day happened to be taken out of the nineteenth chapter of St. Luke, where our Saviour is said to have driven the buyers and sellers out of the temple. An impetus of honest indignation seized me. - I took out my pencil, and wrote the following hasty lines on one of the pannels of the pew I sat in:</p>
            <pb n="1:86" xml:id="pb-1:86" facs="#i104"/>

            <p>surprized at the fallibility of your divines. - </p> <p>Among whom there are many pious ejaculators, who think that I ought to have been excommunicated long ago. - However, I am sure that I am well enough intitled to be received a priest, in the Persian temples at least - as all the initiated were obliged to pass first through a noviciate of reproach and pain, to give proofs of their being free from passion, resentment, and impatience.</p> <p>I am in the same predicament with Cato the censor - not in the severity of his discipline, I confess - but in the particular, at least, of his having</p>
            <pb n="1:88" xml:id="pb-1:88" facs="#i106"/>
            <p>been fourscore times accused. - But he had the advantage of fairer trials than ever I had - for he was as often acquitted.</p> <p>God forgive them! But I forgive them their prayers, in return, on account of an old proverb. - Need I repeat it?</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXII.</p> <p>TOLERATION - OR PERSECUTION.</p> <p>I WAS speaking of these things one day to Voltaire, and he wished me joy of the great happiness and advantages of living in a country where such expressions and allusions, which ignorance or malice might be capable of construing into treason or blasphemy against church or state, could escape the Inquisition or Bastile.</p> <p>He then put into my hand his treatise on Toleration, which had been</p>
            <pb n="1:90" xml:id="pb-1:90" facs="#i108"/>
            <p>but just published. - It is written, like all his works, with great spirit, wit, and learning, to prove, what no fool could ever yet dispute, that persecution, for God's sake, is a most wicked thing, and contrary to reason, nature, and scripture.</p> <p>It appears an extraordinary thing to me, that since there is such a diabolical spirit, in the depravity of human nature, as persecution for difference of opinion in religious tenets, there never happened to be any inquisition, any auto de fÃ©, any crusade, among the Pagans. - </p> <p>That during the ages of ignorance and barbarity, while the devil, as</p>
            <pb n="1:91" xml:id="pb-1:91" facs="#i109"/>
            <p>divines tell us, governed the church, equivocated in their oracles, ordained impurities, and commanded human sacrifices, brethren were not set against brethren, nor nation against nation, in civil fury, or in pious war. - </p> <p>But that, as soon as it had pleased God, by miraculous interposition, to take the church into his own hands, so shocking and impious an aera should thence commence - that the word of peace should call forth the sword, and the precepts of love and concord produce hatred and dissention.</p> <p>The christian - say un-christian - priest informs me, the reason of this</p>
            <pb n="1:92" xml:id="pb-1:92" facs="#i110"/>
            <p>remarkable difference was, that the heathen happened to have no one article of belief worth the quarreling about - as they universally supposed the soul to perish with the body. - Post mortem nihil est, <note>Latin</note> was their creed. - And that even those few, among the philosophers, who admitted of a post-existence, at the same time denied an hell. - Non est unus, says Cicero, tam excors, qui credat.</p> <p>Thus then, continues the good catholic, while the whole of human existence was ignorantly supposed to have been comprehended within the pale of mortal life, peace, friendship, and good-will, were, most certainly,</p>
            <pb n="1:93" xml:id="pb-1:93" facs="#i111"/>
            <p>preferable to war, enmity, and persecution.</p> <p>But when the immortal soul was once put under the care of Christ's Vicar here on earth - how totally unworthy to be stiled Priests of the Lamb, and Oracles of the Dove, must those divines be, who would not cast the body of an heretic into the flames *!</p> <p>I cannot help differing in opinion from orthodoxy of this true catholic tenet; and am more inclined</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* The popish text for broiling, is taken from that passage in scripture, where it is said, hominem haereticum devita - which last word they construe into de vitÃ¢ tollere. <note>Latin</note></p>

            <p>to agree with Cicero, in the passage above quoted, though he was but groping in the dark himself. - For to believe a soul, and damn it, methinks, is not light - but lightning.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXIII.</p> <p>MY RELIGION.</p> <p>WHAT are my own notions about religion? you ask me. - I'll tell you. - I am not on the death-bed.</p> <p>I have both conviction and faith enough in that article to become a methodist, and spiritual warmth sufficient to render me an enthusiast that way; but that, I thank God, I have never yet been wicked enough to rush into such extravagancies.</p>
            <pb n="1:96" xml:id="pb-1:96" facs="#i114"/>
            <p>Passions must be combated by passion. - Therefore, your grievous sinners generally turn devotees. - This is the natural consequence of a sort of people, who, though a paradox, are common enough in life, qui credunt multum, et peccant fortitÃ¨r. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>For my own part, I trust that the gentle breezes of the established orthodoxy of our church may be strong enough to waft my soul to heaven. - I have not such a weight of sin suspended at the tail of my kite, as to require a storm to raise it. - And since the ceasing of the oracles, I think that a person may be inspired with sufficient grace, without falling into convulsions.</p>

            <p>I am as certain that there is a God above, as that I myself am here below. - My certainty is the same - for how otherwise did I come here?</p> <p>"Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus? how here?</p> <p>Not of myself." - </p> <p>He must love virtue, and detest vice. - Consequently, He must both reward and punish. - If we are not accountable creatures, we are surely the most unaccountable animals on the face of the earth.</p> <p>After the spirit is fled, and his body perished in the grave, does the resurrection of man combat thy vain philosophy? - Consult the caterpillar, thou ignorant, and the butterfly shall resolve</p>

            <p>thee. - In its first state, sluggish, helpless, inert - crawling on the face of the earth, and grossly feeding on the herbage of the field. - After its metamorphosis, its resurrection, a winged seraph, gorgeous to behold, light as air, active as the wind, sipping aurorean dew, and extracting nectareous essences, from aromatic flowers *.</p> <p>Has not the improbable fable of the Hydra's heads been long since verified - nay even exceeded, beyond the bounds of the most extravagant fiction, as being absolutely contrary</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Psyche, in the Greek language, signifies both a butterfly, and the soul.</p>

            <p>to the whole course of nature before known - by the polypus, which generates by section? - The analogies of nature sufficiently point out the ways of Providence.</p> <p>Must every thing be impossible, which our insufficience cannot account for? Are there not innumerable mysteries in nature, which accident reveals, or experimental philosophy demonstrates to us, every day? And shall we yet presume to limit the powers of the great Author of that very nature?</p> <p>What was it that created matter? What was it that gave that matter motion? What was it that to matter</p>

            <p>and motion added sensation? What was it that superadded to these, consciousness, intelligence, and reflection? What was it, great God, what was it! - Resolve me, ye infidels, what it was. - Till then, be dumb. - O saddest folly!</p> <p>I. Lewenhoeck, by the help of his glasses, shews you certain fibres in the body of a full grown man, so very fine, that six hundred of them, combined together, but compose the thickness of a single hair of his head.</p> <p>2.

               <p>CHAP. XXXII.</p> <p>THE PAYMENT.</p> <p>THE method I contrived, in order to liquidate my pecuniary obligations to Le Fevre, was this:</p> <p>I happened to be acquainted with a young man, who had been bound apprentice to a stationer in York. - He had just then finished his time, come to set up in London, and had rented a window in one of the flagged alleys in the city.</p>

               <p>I hired one of the panes of glass from my friend, and stuck up the following advertisement on it with a wafer:</p> <p>"Epigrams, anagrams, paragrams, chronograms, monograms, epitaphs, epithalamiums, prologues, epilogues, madrigals, interludes, advertisements, letters, petitions, memorials, on every occasion. - Essays on all subjects. - Pamphlets, for or against the ministry. - With sermons, upon any text, or for any sect - to be written here on reasonable terms - </p> <p>By A- B- Philologer."</p> <p>N.

               <p>The uncommonness of several of the above titles raised the curiosity of the public extremely. - So that besides the applications made to me for the useful species of literature, such as advertisements, petitions, and memorials, many more were made for the chronograms, monograms, paragrams, &amp;c. merely to see the nature of them.</p> <p>At night - or to express myself more poetically - when the evening had assumed its dusk-gown, I used privately to glide into my office, to digest the notes or heads of the day, and receive the earnests, which were directed always to be left with the memorandums. - </p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXVI.</p> <p>THE BREECHES-MAKER.</p> <p>BESIDES, really - as I hope there are none but philosophers by - there are so many ways for a woman to be undone, without the imputation either of vice or wantonness - such accidents, incidents, contingencies, and synchronisms, may happen in her way through life, that unless every circumstance can be fairly stated, and candidly weighed - which must be the great use of the day of judgment - it is morally impossible</p>
            <pb n="1:155" xml:id="pb-1:155" facs="#i173"/>
               <p>for any man, hors d'elle, to determine whether the fair delinquent may have been most deserving of infamy or compassion.</p> <p>I have known several of these equivocal cases myself; - two of which I think proper to indulge the curiosity of my reader with in this place, by way of specifying my argument merely. - </p> <p>The first instance was a very pretty modest young woman, that was only daughter to the clerk of the first parish I ever officiated in. She had been most carefully brought up, went constantly to church with her father, morning and evening; sat upon a</p>

               <p>little stool in the aile, just under the desk; and having a most tuneable voice, used generally to help him to raise the psalm. - </p> <p>There had never appeared the least turn of lightness, forwardness, or flirtation, in any part of this good girl's behaviour, as she grew np. There are usually certain patterns pointed out in every country village; and Miss Amen was the paragon of our parish - till about the age of seventeen, she happened suddenly to disappear - because, it seems, she found herself, as we were soon after informed, to be too big to be seen.</p> <p>The place of her concealment was kept a profound secret from us all for</p>
            <pb n="1:157" xml:id="pb-1:157" facs="#i175"/>
               <p>some months, till after the fair eloper had become the sorrowful mother of a child; when I received a private billet from her, intreating me to grant her an interview the next day, at a little cottage about five miles from the town I lived in; and begging that I would come alone.</p> <p>My humanity, with a little mixture of femality, namely curiosity, induced me to obey the summons most punctually. - I went. - She threw herself on her knees before me, covered her face with her hand, and wept bitterly - but not alone. - </p> <p>After I had spoken comfort to her soul, by preaching to her the great</p>
            <pb n="1:158" xml:id="pb-1:158" facs="#i176"/>
               <p>efficacy of repentance, and calmed her mind, by promising to mediate a reconciliation between her and her unhappy parents, the second part of my errand operated so strongly on me, that I began to question her, in the stile of a confessor, about the whole process, the commencement, progress, and arts which had led to, or were laid for, her undoing.</p> <p>She answered me, with a frankness and a candour that fully persuaded me of her truth and ingenuousness. - She declared to me, that her failure had not proceeded in the least wither from passion or from vice; - that she had never in her life been sensible of any warm desire,</p>

               <p>prompting her from within, nor had even sustained any strong solicitation, urging her from without. - </p> <p>No, reverend Sir, exclaimed the fair penitent, with an heavy sigh, it was nothing of all this, that I am to be cruelly reproached with upon this sad occasion. - It was - it was, alas! my father's trade alone that thus hath wrought my overthrow. - </p> <p>Your father's trade! his trade! I replied, with surprize, the cause of your ruin! - But so indeed the fact was, without peradventure. - </p> <p>Besides the vocation of parish-clerk, old Amen had, it seems, followed the</p>

               <p>occupation of breeches-making also. - He had bred up his daughter to the mysteries of the same manufacture, from the time that she had begun to enter into her teens; - and as ill luck would have it, they happened to be leathern breeches too that he dealt in.</p> <p>The unfortunate girl - now a woman - assured me, that this kind of employment used, by degrees, to occasion certain involuntary wanderings to stray in her mind, which, without ever tainting her chastity in the least, had insensibly, however, sullied the purity of her thoughts; - that she had done every thing in her power to restrain her reflections from running into such reveries; and had</p>
            <pb n="1:161" xml:id="pb-1:161" facs="#i179"/>
               <p>sung psalms for whole evenings together, to divert her attention to fitter subjects of contemplation. - In vain, alas! for while she sung, breeches were still the burthen of her song. - </p> <p>This unlucky image haunted poor mademoiselle Culote continually. - When she lay down the rest, she imagined she saw them taken off, and laid under the pillow; - and when she arose, she fancied still she saw them taken up, and put on again before her eyes.</p> <p>The familiarity of such ideas, though it had not in the least staggered her virtue - and I believe it - yet had pretty nearly produced the</p>
            <pb n="1:162" xml:id="pb-1:162" facs="#i180"/>
               <p>same effect, by discomfiting her modesty - so far, as to prevent a proper alarm, resentment, and resistance from taking place, and coming quick enough to her aid, when she was assailed by the young squire of the manor, for whom she had just finished a neat pair of leathern breeches, which he happened to call on her for, one evening about twilight, when the rest of the family were attending a funeral in the parish.</p> <p>The poor girl! Happy had it been for her, if men had never worn any breeches at all, or that they had even worn them as the Chiriguanes are reported to do theirs - as fops wear their hats - under their arms. - We</p>

               <p>communing with herself about the matters and things which could occasion all this bustle and stir. - </p> <p>She had a vast turn to philosophy. - She would get at her father's books - she would sometimes read more than she understood - but happened often to understand more than she was the better for. - It made her wiser, forsooth - but, alack! how dearly have we since paid for the first instance of female wisdom! 'Twas in this very science, they say, that the first curiosity was exercised. - The knowing ones are sometimes taken in.</p> <p>Her father told me, one day, soon after her accident, she had declared</p>

               <p>to him, that, without labouring under the power or influence of any other inordinate passion or propensity in nature, her curiosity was so predominant in her, that she would, at any time of her life, have stood a shot to have been made a free-mason.</p> <p>O philosophia! dux vitae! <note>Latin</note> - The deuce it is! - But pray, Sir, is there not such a theorem in this same philosophy, as that action and re-action are equal - and in opposite directions too? And is not the natural philosophy ever still at fifty-cuffs with the moral one? - In such conflicts as these the fair Obstetrica fell!</p> <p>But the philosophy, of all others, that finally tript up poor miss Mid-wife's</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXVIII.</p> <p>ORIGIN OF TRISTRAM SHANDY.</p> <p>UPON turning over this manuscript just now, I find that I had mentioned a design of writing my own memoirs once, upon a time.</p> <p>I did really sit down to this work formerly, with the most serious and stupid intention possible. - But the Brutum fulmen, or Will o' the wisp of imagination, glared full before me, and led me a scamper, over hedge and ditch, through briars, though</p>

               <p>quagmires, and quick-sands, for nine intire volumes, before I attempted to introduce myself into life. - In truth, great part of that work was spent before I even pretended to have been born. - I knew the world, alas! too well, to be in any manner of hurry to step into it.</p> <p>The oddness and novelty of the first volumes caught hold of the capricious taste of the public. - I was applauded and abused, censured and defended, through many a page. - However, as there were more readers than judges, the edition had sufficient vogue for a sale. - This encouraged me - I went on still with the same kind of no meaning; singing, at the</p>

               <p>to trace my clue, through every volume, without losing once sight of the connection. - A fine spirit of enthusiasm this! - With what intelligence and profit must such persons read the Apocalypse! - A millennium must certainly be a very clear case with them.</p> <p>However, I must have the modesty to admit, that there were, here and there, some striking passages interspersed throughout those volumes. - In sterquilinio margaritam reperit. - <note>Latin</note> There are many foibles ridiculed, and much charity and benevolence instilled and recommended. - One saunters out, sometimes, into the fields and highways, without any</p>

               <p>that having been struck with that rich vein of philanthropy, she was pleased to say, which flowed like milk and money through all my writings, Mrs. -------- would be much obliged, and flattered, if I would afford her an opportunity of personal acquaintance with the author, by doing her the favour of drinking tea with her that evening.</p> <p>I was too weak to venture abroad.

               <p>a considerable time before. - But one who has run down a hill for any way, cannot well stop his speed, till he has got to the bottom of it.</p> <p>I then thought proper to cease titupping my hobby-horse about - to alight, and perform my promise to the public in a more ingenuous and systematical manner. - Upon which occasion, I began to frame these notes - but could never since find time to glaze them. - So many other themes and schemes shot across my fancy, and puzzled my purpose, that I could not stick to any one subject long enough to make a volume of it - or acquit myself as an author.</p>

There is, I confess, a certain connate liberality of nature in some persons I have met with, that inspires them to think, speak, and act, with a spirit and virtue which supersedes, in a great measure, the necessity of education. These instances,</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Here read the dedication over again.</p>

They then begin to look upon their own feelings to be the sure way of judging, and the usages of the world their only rule of acting.</p> <p>From hence may illiberal notions are suffered to obtain, and many ignoble deeds are practised. - From hence arise, among the great, New-market jockies, Change-alley brokers, and corporation casuists. - From hence the dignitaries of the law degenerate</p>

They would then be taught to perceive, that neither their own feelings, nor the usages of the world, were of authority sufficient to support vice, meanness, or indecorum.</p> <p>This would be putting them to school again. - Those who want hearts, should be taught to get by heart.</p>

               <p>of our modern laws, that divorces, now-a-days, like the section of the polypus, are suffered to generate new members from each part of the separation.</p> <p>I am not such a visionary as to expect that any thing of this kind would render persons virtuous, in spite of the whole course of modern education. - <note>Latin</note> Et quae fuerunt vitia, mores sunt. - But I think that it might possibly shame your grown nobility, gentry, and others, into the disguising, or concealing their vices at least; - which is, perhaps, no inconsiderable point gained in morals.</p> <p>Est quadam prodire tenus - Si non datur ultra.</p>
            <pb n="1:188" xml:id="pb-1:188" facs="#i206"/>
               <p>The appearing, or pretending to have more virtue than one has, is hypocrisy; - but the not exposing all the vices we are really guilty of, is certainly some merit - to the public at least.</p> <p>So shall dissembling once be virtuous in you.</p> <p>A rich lawyer might, perhaps, notwithstanding, be tempted to purchase an estate for half its value, because the person who sold it did so in haste, to extricate himself from a gaol. - But after he had perused my little book, he would never have boasted of the action. - My ears would not then be so much shocked and offended as they are too frequently now every day.</p>
            <pb n="1:189" xml:id="pb-1:189" facs="#i207"/>
               <p>A profligate might still delude a simple maiden, or purchase the innocency of beauty from a needy parent; but he would not make a confident of such amours. - He would not cast the victim off to want, as well as infamy; nor dare to proclaim his villainy to the world. My enmity, my abhorrence, my resentment, with all the tribe of the uncomfortable, the uncharitable, and unhealthy passions, would not then harrass my poor shattered frame.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLI.</p> <p>THE NATURAL EXHIBITION.</p> <p>ANOTHER vision of mine, was, to open an exhibition for fine children, male and female, remarkable for their beauty, symmetry, or athletic frame. In order to which, I had prepared a new and copious edition of the Callipaedia - or, Art of getting Pretty Children; illustrated with notes of my own, and enlarged with several philosophic hints, which had occurred to my mind whilst this pleasant fancy was running in my head.</p>
            <pb n="1:191" xml:id="pb-1:191" facs="#i209"/>
               <p>There have been many schools opened, for the exhibition of all the arts and science; but none, O shame! for nature, and her originals. He who copies the human face-divine, receives a premium, and applause - while he that presents you with the master-piece, or prototype, of the mimic work, has but his labour for his pains - or, at best, is referred, like virtue, to its own reward. - </p> <p>This might encourage the good old moral and political work of propagation. - It would be reviving something similar to the useful Roman law, the jus trium liberorum - <note>Latin</note> and be a restraint on promiscuous intercourses, which terminate in barrenness. - Profligacy</p>

               <p>is a monster, and never generates.</p> <p>I can conceive no other reason for such a scheme as this not having yet become an object of the royal foundation, except that his present majesty might have so justly thought that his own family would be best intitled to the greatest emoluments of it, both from excellence and number.</p> <p>I have amused myself sometimes in one of my philosophic moods, with supposing an handsome, well-made young couple setting out on such a project as this. I will not indulge the freedom of imagination on this subject - though well assured I am,</p>
            <pb n="1:193" xml:id="pb-1:193" facs="#i211"/>
               <p>that the Author of beauty, harmony, and order, cannot be displeased with a disquisition into it.</p> <p>Can the origin of nature be jealous at our investigation of the very inmost recesses of its secrets?</p> <p>Philosophy would become impiety at such a thought.</p> <p>Many other projects of these kinds, sufficient loquacem delassare Fabium <note>Latin</note> to relate, and which would require the age of a patriarch to execute - besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking - have presented themselves to my active imagination, even in the midst of pain, sorrow, and sickness; - but I never was able to carry them further than minutes.</p>
            <pb n="1:194" xml:id="pb-1:194" facs="#i212"/>
               <p>For my mind has ever represented the jargon of the schools, with regard to matter, which is defined to possess a conatus ad motum, <note>Latin</note> with a vis inertiae, or perfect acquiescence ad requiem, at the same time. - You may see what a fine thing this same learning is.</p>
            <pb n="1:195" xml:id="pb-1:195" facs="#i213"/>
               <p>CHAP. XLII.</p> <p>THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.</p> <p>I FIND myself labouring, this instant, under an irresistible impulse to mention one particular design of mine - because 'tis of a singular nature - which was, to write an historical and philosophical account and description of all the several great epochas of the world, from the creation to the conflagration - from the beginning of time, when God said, Let there be light, and there was light; till the end of it, when he shall say, Let there be fire, and there shall be fire.</p>
            <pb n="1:196" xml:id="pb-1:196" facs="#i214"/>
               <p>As there is but one notable event to be expected, between the present aera and the final consummation of all things - namely, the gathering in of all nations, so as that all may become one faith - when Turks, Jews, Infidels, and Hereticks - Papists, Presbyterians, Jansenists, Methodists, Moravians, Quietists, Arrians, Hugonots, Socinians, Anabaptists, Muggletonians, Swaddlers, and Quakers - are there any more of them? - shall all become good protestants of the church of England, as by law established.</p> <p>This might, I say, at first, appear a difficulty upon me. - But on considering the train that has been already</p>
            <pb n="1:197" xml:id="pb-1:197" facs="#i215"/>
               <p>laid, both in church and state, to bring that matter to pass, I fancy that the intelligent reader will be of opinion with me, that it requires but a competent knowledge in politics and theology, to be able to predict the time when, and the manner how, this great crisis must be brought to pass.</p> <p>I gave my sentiments on this subject some years ago, in a private letter to Frederic the Third, his present majesty of Prussia. - Pray, now I think of it, do you know what became of that paper? It was put into the hands of the Prussian minister here, to be presented to his master, and we have heard no more of the matter since.</p>
            <pb n="1:198" xml:id="pb-1:198" facs="#i216"/>
               <p>But to conclude - </p> <p>As the first thing in intention is generally the last in execution, I have proceeded in this work accordingly, by writing backwards, or Hebrew-wise, and shall here present you with the last chapter first.</p>

               <p>THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE EPOCHAS.</p> <p>ARGUMENT.</p> <p>THE LAST DAY.</p> <p>The pillar'd firmament is rotteness,</p> <p>And earth's base built on stubble. MILT.</p> <p>NOX, Erebus, and Chaos, now renewed their reign. - All nature was convulsed. - The panther, lion, and the leopard, fled affrighted from their dens, and, tamed by terror, grew the friends of man. - The world became an ark, and adverse beasts forgot their wonted strife, and</p>

               <p>sought alliance in each other's fierceness. - The howling wolf now bleated like the lamb. - The hawk, the vulture, and the eagle, became pigeon-livered, and lacked gall. - The birds of rapine forsook their prey, and trembled for themselves. - The shark, the dolphin, and leviathan, merged from the boiling deep, and sought the fervid shore. - The elements themselves were changed in nature's wreck. - The rivers were dried up, and liquid ore supplied their burning channels. - The clouds were turned to fire, and shot their meteors through the astonished sky. - The air was flame, and breathing was no more. - The firmament was melted</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLIII.</p> <p>MYSELF.</p> <p>AND here, perhaps, since I have got into a train of describing myself, it may amuse you - or myself - which makes very little different, in the mood I am at present - to give you the character and peculiarities of Tria juncta in uno: - <note>Latin</note> to which purpose I shall appropriate the whole of this chapter.</p> <p>The first and principal characteristic of my idoles - not indolence - for it is</p>
            <pb n="1:203" xml:id="pb-1:203" facs="#i221"/>
               <p>as active as passionate - is philanthropy. - This is my divinity, in which I live, and move, and have my being.</p> <p>The momentum of my affections toward mankind is in a reciprocal ration between heaven and earth. I place myself as a medium - and love others with that warmth and indulgence I would have my Creator manifest toward myself - forgiving their errors, palliating their infirmities, and willing both their temporal and eternal felicity. - Amen!</p> <p>This turn of mind is the first thing that awakens with me, and the last I</p>
            <pb n="1:204" xml:id="pb-1:204" facs="#i222"/>
               <p>part with when I take leave of my senses. - I have frequently supposed myself a sovereign prince, and spent many an intire day in settling my household, with all the other offices and departments of my kingdom.</p> <p>Nay, I do actually aver, that I sat down gravely one morning to a sheet of paper, and entered the names of all my friends and acquaintance for employs; classing them according to their respective merits and capacities, preferring still, as becomes a king to do, superior talents and virtue, to my fondest connections. - </p> <p>Pray, was not this a scene for Moor-fields? And would not such a manuscript</p>
            <pb n="1:205" xml:id="pb-1:205" facs="#i223"/>
               <p>as this, found in my possession, appear to have been copied from charcoal on the walls of a cell? Nay, I do confess, that I did once seriously think myself mad, for a considerable portion of my life, on account of such reveries and extravagancies as these - till I happily found out that my suspicion arose chiefly from my having kept company, during that sad interval, with a parcel of LUKE-warm fools.</p> <p>At other times, I have absolutely refused being a king. I burned my list, and cried out, Nolo coronari. - <note>Latin</note> This station did not sufficiently satisfy my thirst of power and dominion. It extended only to the temporal welfare</p>
            <pb n="1:206" xml:id="pb-1:206" facs="#i224"/>
               <p>of mankind, and was restricted to that scanty portion of them which was comprehended within the narrow limits of my own empire - and could bear an insurance only during my own life.</p> <p>I prefer Socrates to Solon, and would rather preside in the moral than the political government of mankind. - This is the only true ambition, to assume to one's self that department in life which extends equally to all nations, to all ages, and reaches even to eternity itself. - </p> <p>I am, perhaps, one of the greatest philosophers you know in the world. - Men of sense admire, and fools</p>
            <pb n="1:207" xml:id="pb-1:207" facs="#i225"/>
               <p>envy this supposed superiority of talent in me. - They think it must have been atchieved by dint of study, labour, and resolution, with the natural advantages of a gifted capacity, and great strength of mind.</p> <p>I would not have them think so: - in the first place, because it is not true; - and in the next, such a notion as this might deter others from ever attempting to arrive at such an happy, but easy excellence of character. - Let me undeceive them. - </p> <p>I was as other men are, till about the age of two-and-twenty. - I resented pain, sickness, disappointment, and distress, as naturally as I did heat</p>
            <pb n="1:208" xml:id="pb-1:208" facs="#i226"/>
               <p>and cold, hunger and thirst. - I had ever a turn for reflection. - I lay tumbling and tossing one morning in bed, my mind labouring just then under the pressure of some one or more of the above catalogue of ills, and contemplating the infinite superiority of the ancient philosophy, upon all such trials as these.</p> <p>I envied, I admired this happy possession of one's own mind. I took heart of grace, on the instant, and filliping my fingers, cried out, I will myself be a philosopher. I immediately arose - resolving not to fall asleep again, and forget it. - I put on the breeches of a philosopher - possibly, at that time, of an heathen one - and</p>
            <pb n="1:209" xml:id="pb-1:209" facs="#i227"/>
               <p>so commenced philosopher for life - and I also am a painter. - </p> <p>This, be assured of it, gentlemen, was the only lesson or degree I ever took in that truly noble science of defence - and found it to be all-sufficient. - </p> <p>The difficulties we apprehend, more than those we find, in an attempt of this kind, as well as in the strife with all our passions, is the only thing that prevents philosophy and virtue from being commonly attainable in general life.</p> <p>What makes the difference, between a chaste woman, and a frail one? The one had struggled, and the other</p>
            <pb n="1:210" xml:id="pb-1:210" facs="#i228"/>
               <p>note. - Between a brave man, and a coward? The one had struggled, and the other not. - An honest man, and a knave? One had struggled, the other not. - </p> <p>I am generally chearful - but more remarkably lively under pain, sickness, or misfortunes - provided the misfortune be all my own - than at any other time of my life. Visiting the sick ceases to be a scripture duty, when referred to me. - Folks crowd to my couch, not to bemoan, but be merry at, my sufferings - to hear me confess wit on the rack, and refine my ore in the crucible.</p> <p>A friend of mine, thinking me expiring once under the severe disorder</p>
            <pb n="1:211" xml:id="pb-1:211" facs="#i229"/>
               <p>of a bilious cholic - and I should certainly have popped, at that very instant, if I had not, most luckily, been given over by three physicians - and consequently no longer plied with medicine. My friend, I say, expressed himself extremely shocked at the indecent merriment, as he stiled it, with which I was just going out of the world. - The reply I made him was, pretty nearly, in these words: - </p> <p>"Your lazy or indolent christian is too apt to cherish in his mind a dangerous opinion of the efficacy of a death-bed repentance. - I was never mad enough to trust to it. - When Socrates was asked, just before his trial, why he did not prepare</p>

               <p>himself for his defence, he nobly answered, I have been doing nothing else all my life.</p> <p>"He who defers the great work of salvation till his last moments, hath loitered away his time, till the night cometh, in which no man can work. - A death-bed attrition * - and what is it more, when it comes to that? - may be compared to Vanini's last exclamation - who, though an atheist all his life, called upon God in the flames.</p> <p>"Shall an apoplexy deprive us of salvation? If not, then what but fear need render us so dismal on</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Repentance through fear of punishment, not sorrow for sin; which later is called contrition.</p>
            <pb n="1:213" xml:id="pb-1:213" facs="#i231"/>
               <p>our exit? Life is itself a jest - Then surely death must be the very cream of it. - The longest life is as short as an epigram, and our end is but the point of it."</p> <p>My sober friend walked away into a corner of the bed-chamber, and ejaculated.</p>
            <pb n="1:214" xml:id="pb-1:214" facs="#i232"/>
               <p>CHAP. XLIV.</p> <p>A SHORT CHAPTER.</p> <p>WHAT a chapter was the last! There will be no end of it, if I once get into a habit of writing such long ones. - But whenever self happens to become the subject, one seldom knows when to have done. - This is the only theme upon which I was ever tempted to expatiate - which, in other words, is to be tedious.</p> <p>For, in general, my writings do not smell much of the lamp. - They seem most of them rather to have been written when I had natural light enough - even at the very full of the moon. - Can the Critical Reviewers themselves say any thing worse of them?</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLV.</p> <p>A SHORTER.</p> <p>BUT even these short chapters appear too prolix to me - I hope not to you - though they contain, each of them, only one head a-piece. SO that I am resolved here to put an end to them all, and write nothing but sentences, throughout the second volume.</p> <p>I am not so vain as to think that my proverbs will be as good as Solomon's - or Sancho's either - but this I will venture to say, that they shall beat them all to nothing in number.</p> <p>END OF PART I.</p> <p>WHICH CONCLUDES VOL.

               <p>THE</p> <p>AUTHOR</p> <p>TO THE READER.</p> <p>WHETHER any of the following thoughts or remarks have been conceived by others, before me, or no, I cannot pretend to say; for as they spontaneously occurred to my mind, I minuted them down, without ever taking the trouble of inquiring into their origin or derivation.</p> <p>And in truth, a labour of this kind would have been infinite and uncertain</p>
            <pb n="2:6" xml:id="pb-2:6" facs="#i242"/>
               <p> - for it is almost impossible, after all, for any person who reads much, and reflects a good deal, to be able, upon every occasion, to determine whether a thought was another's, or his own. - Nay, I declare, that I have several times quoted sentences out of my own writings, in aid of my own arguments in conversation; thinking that I was supporting them by some better authority.</p> <p>For my own part, I do affirm, that it would afford me a most flattering pleasure to find them all imputed - For as I can truly acquit my conscience of the least manner of plagiarism, this very coincidence of sentiment and opinions, would serve to prove the justness of them, pretty nearly - as two clocks which chime together, very probably mark the right hour of</p>
            <pb n="2:7" xml:id="pb-2:7" facs="#i243"/>
               <p>the day - for the degrees of error are so numerous and various, while the point of truth is but simplex, duntaxat, et unum, <note>Latin</note> that the odds must be manifold, that no two irregular agents shall exactly hit upon the same false measure.</p> <p>But that nothing is new under the sun, was declared by Solomon some years ago; and it is impossible to provide against evils that have already some to pass. - So that I am sure I have reason to cry out, with Donatus, apud Jerom -</p> <p>Pereant, qui, antÃ¨ nos, nostra dixerunt!</p> <p>For I have ever wrote without study, books, or example, and yet have been over-charged with having borrowed this hint from Rabelais, that from Montaigne, another from Martinus</p>
            <pb n="2:8" xml:id="pb-2:8" facs="#i244"/>
               <p>Scriblerus, &amp;c. without having ever read the first, or remembered a word of the latter.</p> <p>So that all we can possibly say, of the most original authors, now-a-days, is, not that they say any thing new, but only that they are capable of saying such and such things themselves, if they had never been said before them.</p> <p>But as monarchs have a right to call in the specie of a state, and raise its value, by their own impression, so are there certain prerogative geniuses, who are above plagiaries - who cannot be said to steal, but from their improvement of a thought, rather to borrow it, and repay the commonwealth of letters with interest again; and may more properly be said to adopt,</p>
            <pb n="2:9" xml:id="pb-2:9" facs="#i245"/>
               <p>than to kidnap, a sentiment, by leaving it heir to their own fame.</p> <p>I do not pretend to class myself among such privileged wits. - I never borrow, lest I should not be able to pay - but have only made the above remark, to shew the candor of my own criticism upon all such occurrences as these.</p> <p>It may, perhaps, be requisite here to explain a new term I have made use of in the title page of this part of my work. The word Callimachies I have framed from Callimachus, the name of a Greek poet, or whom it is said, that he had written above eight hundred elegant poems, which were all comprehended in about five hundred pages.</p>
            <pb n="2:10" xml:id="pb-2:10" facs="#i246"/>
               <p>I was pleased with this character of his works. - I hate your scriptus et in tergo <note>Latin</note> authors - and have therefore taken the liberty of denominating all concise or sententious writings Callimachies, after his name. I thought it adviseable to give this definition of the word, lest the Critical Reviewers should derive it from the French phrase Gallimatias. - </p> <p>I like this manner of writing extremely. - It is really being too hard upon the public, to turn over a new leaf with them, upon an old score, continually. - And whenever my bookseller, who buys by the bulk - and such works deserve to remain on it - obliges me to augment my pages, I generally contrive to give the reader some new subject - or none at all - which does as well, as it serves</p>
            <pb n="2:11" xml:id="pb-2:11" facs="#i247"/>
               <p>equally for amusement to find one out.</p> <p>But indeed, if the editor of these loose sheets - I don't mean immodest ones - would take my advice, for his own profit, he would by no means publish them at all - but sell them privately, to some of the wit-less authors of the present age, who have attained to a certain knack of writing, both in prose and verse, without matter, fancy, or invention - </p> <p>Without one thought to interrupt the song.</p> <p>This collection then might, perhaps, serve to embellish their works, and help them off the bulk a little.</p> <p>Farewel, neighbour - </p> <p>TRIA JUNCTA IN UNO. <note>Latin</note></p>

There is a great stiffness in the stile and manner of Pliny's Epistles. - This was his character throughout; for he professes himself an admirer of evergreens, clipt into the shapes of men and other animals. - I think, that Orrery was a fitter translator for him than Melmoth, for that reason.</p> <p>5. Political and natural connections are different ideas. - I look upon</p>

There is no such thing as an impartial representation. - A looking-glass, one might be apt to imagine, was an exception to this proposition; and yet we never see out own faces justly in one. It gives us nothing but the translations of them. A mirror even reverses our features, and presents out left-hand for our right. - This is an emblem of all personal reflections.</p> <p>7. I prefer a private to a public life. - For I love my friends, and therefore love but few.</p> <p>8. The confinement of the unity of time, in the drama, forces the poet</p>

There is such a torture, happily unknown to antient tyranny, as talking a man to death.

Mr. Guthrie, in his Essay on Tragedy, distinguishes between a poet and a genius. He must have meant only rhimers, versifiers, or poetasters; for I will not admit a person to be a poet, without a genius.</p> <p>13. One does not require nor think of a fire, often, in spring or autumn; yet I don't know how it is, but when we have happened by chance to pass near one, the sensation it communicates is so pleasant, that we feel rather inclined to indulge it.</p> <p>This is analogous to temptation - and the moral is, keep away from the fire. - </p>

               <p> - Who venture in,</p> <p>Have half acquiesced in the sin.</p> <p>This is the sentiment of some poet; but I cannot make out the distich. - Nor is it at all material; for that sentence must be poor, indeed, that owes its merit to its metre. - Weight, not measure, is the proper standard of true sterling.</p> <p>14. Custom is too apt to obtain a sanction, by becoming a second nature. - This should be admitted only in indifferent matters; for in others, use only renders abuse familiar, and makes custom the more reprehensible.</p> <p>15. Persons of sense foresee a crisis, and temporize with occasion. Short-sighted people never comply, till occasion becomes necessity - and then it is often too late.</p>

               <p>16. Some folk think it sufficient to be good christians, without being good men - so spend their lives in whoring, drinking, cheating - and praying.</p> <p>17. Some people pass through life, soberly and religiously enough, without knowing why, or reasoning about it - but, from force of habit merely, go to heaven, like fools.</p> <p>18. Mechanical christians make an office of their pews, for the dispatch of business.</p> <p>19. Going to prayer with bad affections, is like paying one's levee in an undress. - </p> <p>There is a great deal of this species of wit, in many admired writings, where the simile falls short of the comparison.</p>

               <p>20. Religion was too abstracted before the coming of our Saviour. - But the cloathing the Divinity with matter, hath presented us with a sensible object for our adoration - which was absolutely necessary to attract the devotion of the many. - For a philosophic religion is a religion - for a philosopher only.</p> <p>21. Marcus Aurelius says, that he had learned from Apollonius, not to be impatient when his arguments happened not to be apprehended. - </p> <p>I think there is a reason, besides the philosophic one, for this. - A person ought rather to triumph, upon the advantages of superior knowlege or understanding; which should incline him more to pity than resentment.</p>

When I see good men dying often, while worthless fellows are suffered to live, I feel the force of that passage in the Psalms most emphatically - The Lord wisheth not the death of a sinner.</p> <p>24. The nibbling of critics, like the mites in cheese, depreciate a work to some, but enrich it to others. Quere? - </p> <p>Men tire themselves in pursuit of rest. The reply of Callisthenes to Alexander may be here applied - Was it Callisthenes, or -------? Not material - though some literary</p>

               <p>blockheads would perhaps make a bustle about it.</p> <p>26. It is an impious prostitution of the sacrament, to administer it to the adulterer, the oppressor, or as a test, merely by way of qualification, for some temporal office. Those only should be admitted to the communion who qualify themselves for the next world - not those who receive it solely for this.</p> <p>27. Titles of honour are like the impressions on coin - which add no value to gold and silver, but only render brass current.</p> <p>28. There is no such thing as real happiness in life. The justest definition that was ever given of it, was, A tranquil acquiescence under an agreeable delusion. - I forget where.</p>

               <p>29. I have known many men who have worn out what little sense had been born with them, long before their deaths - but yet, having been trained up in office business, or some mechanical trade - as the army, or the church - continue to pass through them still, like children in a go-cart, without either suspecting themselves, or being detected by others.</p> <p>If you slice off the head of a turkey-cock, after it has been once set a-running, it will continue to keep striding on, in the same stalking gait, for several yards, before it drops.</p> <p>I have known several people pass through life, plausibly enough, with as little brains as an headless turkey-cock.</p> <p>30.

               <p>But the genius that pleased and puzzled me the most, was the author of the following stanza:</p> <p>"Come, ake you glass,</p> <p>The northern lass</p> <p>So prettily advised. - </p> <p>I took my glass,</p> <p>And really was</p> <p>Agreeably surprized."</p> <p>Upon which arise two questions, equally interesting, to be resolved here - namely, What was the glass? And what the surprize?</p> <p>The latter, indeed, he lets us into the secret of, in the next verse - which happens to be the lass's beauty - and we are to suppose this to have been the very first time he had ever seen it - by his being so much surprized at the sight. - But then, why not surprized, before he had taken his glass, as well as after? - Which leads us to</p>
            <pb n="2:28" xml:id="pb-2:28" facs="#i264"/>
               <p>the solution of the first question, what manner of glass this was.</p> <p>Here the commentators differ extremely - one sect affirming it to have been a magnifying glass - which had surprizingly increased the dimensions of those charms, which had appeared nothing remarkable to the naked eye before.</p> <p>Another opinion, and to which, I confess, I more incline, as being the most orthodox, is, that it must have been a drinking-glass - That the northern lass, being somewhat chilly, had challenged our poet to take a bout with her - and had bumpered him into a sort of Scotch - or second sight - or, in other words, had plied him up to that pitch of potation, when men are said to see double. - By which means it became a multiplying-glass - </p>
            <pb n="2:29" xml:id="pb-2:29" facs="#i265"/>
               <p>which must have increased the number of her charms to so agreeably surprizing a degree as the lover appears to have been so enraptured at.</p> <p>And what serves, in my opinion, to render this the more natural interpretation of the difficulty, is, that philosophy has observed, in proportion as men grow warm with wine, their penchant toward the act of multiplication grows stronger and stronger.</p> <p>32. Zed led a sort of zig-zag life, gaining his points by indirect courses, as a ship makes her voyage, by tacks, in an adverse wind.</p> <p>33. Varium et mutabile semper femina. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>VIRG.</p> <p>These epithets are said to be synonimous. - I think not. - The first expression alludes to the temper, and the second regards the affections.</p>

I never knew but one person who interfered between man and wife either with safety or success. - Upon a domestic pro and con once between the parties, that was rising even to blows, a friend of mine, who happened to be by, hit the husband a stroke with his right-hand, crying, "Be quiet, you brute;" and struck the woman at the same time with his left, saying, "Hold your tongue, you vixen." - Then repeating his moral admonitions, and friendly buffets, with a "Peace, you monster - </p>

Poets should turn philosophers in age, as Pope did. - We are apt to grow chilly, when we sit out our fire.</p> <p>37.

The definition of the Godhead is, that his intelligence requires no reasoning. - Neither propositions, premises, nor deductions, are necessary to him. - He is purely intuitive. - Sees equally what every thing is, or is possible to be. - All truths are but one idea only. - All space but a single point, and eternity itself but an instant.</p> <p>This is a truly philosophic idea of the Godhead; and is suited to it alone, in one very peculiar sense - that any being, less than infinite, would be rendered miserable by such endowments. - Reasoning, investigation, progressive knowlege; hopes, completions, variety, society, &amp;c. would be at an end.</p>

               <p>The sole pleasures of such a being, if not God, must be those of a brute - reduced to sensuality alone. - This must have been the state of your demi-gods, if ever there had been any such - your bull and swan Jupiters - your swine-wallowing Bacchus's - your B-lt-m--e Pluto's - &amp;c.</p> <p>43. A clever fellow. - The word clever is an adjunct, in which all the learned languages are deficient. - There is no expression in any of them which conveys the comprehensive idea of this epithet.</p> <p>May we not from hence suppose, that the character here intended, as well as the expression, is peculiar to these kingdoms? - And indeed it is in a land of liberty only that a man can be completely clever.</p>

O navis! referent te, &amp;c. - </p> <p>The comparing a commonwealth to a ship, is one of the justest allusions in politics that can be imagined. - But this simile is more peculiarly adapted to Great Britain than to any other state in the world; as it has a double right to it, both as an island, and the first maritime power, both in naval strength and commerce.</p> <p>Whenever, therefore, I hear of our entering into a Continental war, I</p>

And if the crown should refuse its assent to wholesome laws, the commons can, in turn, with-hold its revenues.</p> <p>But the lords are independent of controul. - They may prevent the passing of any bill they please, and the community has no manner of redress against them.

A certain person had once done me a signal piece of service, but had afterwards behaved himself very unworthily toward me. - An occasion soon occurred, which put it into my power to requite his ill offices; and I was urged to take advantage of it, by a friend of mine - or rather, an enemy of his.</p> <p>I objected, that this man had formerly obliged and served me. - True, he replied; but surely his ill behaviour since that time, has sufficiently cancelled both the service and the obligation.</p>

The scripture has inculcated a precept to forgive our enemies. - How much stronger then must the text imply the forgiveness of our friends?</p> <p>The disobligation, therefore, being thus cancelled by religion, leaves the obligation without abatement, in moral. - A kindness can never be cancelled - not even by repaying it.</p> <p>71.

               <p>virtue which proceeds from a mere natural good disposition, or a regard to ethic beauty only, is so far from having any merit with God, that it is made a doubt, by the thirteenth article of our faith, whether it does not partake of the nature of sin.</p> <p>So that mere simple virtue, according to this opinion, must take up with its concomitant pleasure for its reward - as no action, which does not spring wholly from a religious principle, and is not dictated either by our love or obedience to God - and does not direct itself, either actually or virtually, immediately or ultimately, to his glory, can be, in the least degree, intitled to the promises of the gospel.</p> <p>And those miserable sinners, Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Epictetus, Titus,</p>

               <p>74. Socrates, in the Phedon, makes a great difference between virtue and habit, with regard to the allotments hereafter. He says, that a person who behaves well, from a moral principle, shall be intitled to an infinitely higher reward, than one who fills up the same measure of duty merely from use or exercise.</p> <p>This is a fine reflexion in a pagan. - The christian divines carry their distinction much farther, by giving the same advantage to religion over morals, that Socrates does to morals over habit.</p> <p>75.

I take the errors and absurdities of the Roman catholic tenets and doctrines to have arisen merely from this - That as soon as the christian religion came to make its way in the world, to be established in governments, and endowed with lands, benefices, jurisdictions, and other temporal emoluments, certain deists, or moral heathens, began to attack the church, as a mere political institution, framed to overturn states and kingdoms - urging, that there appeared to</p>

The extravagant encomiums that have been handed down to us from the antient critics, of many of those authors whose works have been long swallowed up in the gulph of time, and whose names are commemorated only in their commentaries, might make us lament the loss of so much wit, humour, and fine writing,</p>

               <p>as is there pretended, if the fragments of some of them, which, by their being preserved, we may reasonable suppose to have been the choicest parts, did not afford us an opportunity of judging a little for ourselves.</p> <p>And upon such a critical review, I dare say, that a candid reader will think those writings which have happily escaped to us intire, or even maimed, are worth the whole library of those that lie intombed with their authors. Vide Les jugemens des sÃ§avans, par M. Baillet, for five volumes of such sort of stuff.</p> <p>127. One should read both antient and modern critics with extreme diffidence, upon the subjects of literature. - The difference, nay the contrariety, of opinions, given by persons</p>

               <p>of equal judgment, capacity, and learning, upon the very same work, must surprize us extremely, if we were not to consider critics to be in the same situation with lovers. - Smitten with some features, which another eye might possibly perceive no manner of beauty in, they are apt fondly to impute perfection to the whole.</p> <p>So that, in one case, as well as the other, the old adage de gustibus non, <note>Latin</note> may be affirmed. - And therefore it is not the judgments or the sense of the commentators we have any pretence to reprehend, but their taste, their sympathy, their enivremens, only. - Let us then always judge, taste, or feel, for ourselves, and not be misled by great names.</p>

               <p>128. Among the many curious impertinences of the schools, there is none that appears to me so truly ridiculous, as the strife about the authority of the works of the antients. - Is it the author, or the writing we admire or criticse? But it is still the authors we have before us, no matter for their names, when we are commenting upon any work of genius.</p> <p>I do not care one farthing whether Pisander's or Virgil's manuscript - Macrobius affirms the first - was the original of the second AEneid - or Apollonius of Rhodes the author of the fourth. - Whether one Homer, of seven cities, framed the Iliad and the Odyssey intire, or only tacked a parcel of old ballads together, and sung them about the streets of I Smyrna,</p>
            <pb n="2:85" xml:id="pb-2:85" facs="#i321"/>
               <p>2 Rhodes, 3 Colophon, 4 Salamis, 5 Chios, 6 Argos, or 7 Athens, to the title of The blind beggar-man's garland.</p> <p>I do not pretend to say that we have Virgil or Homer before us, when we read those works imputed to them. - But we have certainly the writers of them - which is all we need contend for. And I really think that those scholars who affect a precision in this very immaterial matter, are not a bit wiser than a very pretty woman, who asked me once, with the sweetest smile imaginable, Who was the author of Shakespeare's plays?</p> <p>129. Charles had a sort of philosophy, without reflexion, that reconciled him to every thing. Among the other particulars of his life, he was</p>

Scaliger stiles titillation a sixth sense. - And certainly there is as great a difference, between being tickled and simple feeling, as between taste and touch.</p> <p>but then the same overstrained philosophy might as well deem the sea to be fifth element, because it differs so much from common water. - For titillation, like the briny wave, is but a stronger or more pungent sensation - one of the taste, the other of the touch.</p> <p>131.

In part of lord Kaims's Elements of criticism, he says, that music improves the relish of a banquet. - That I deny - any more than painting might do. They may both be additional pleasures, as well as conversation is - but are perfectly distinct notices; and cannot, with the least propriety, be said to mix or blend with the repast, as none of them serve to raise the flavour of the wine, the sauce, the meat, or help to quicken appetite. - But music and painting both add a spirit to devotion, and elevate the ardor *.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* See what Triglyph says upon music at meals. - Triumvirate, chap. lxxiv.</p>

A toad, fed on the vapours of a dungeon, is not such a wretch, as a man of sense, who has had the misfortune to be heartily in love with a weak or worthless woman.</p> <p>Women are apt to be vain of such a conquest; but more, as the poet expresses it, for the triumph than the prize. - For otherwise, a fool they would count greater gain. They ignorantly flatter themselves, that they have been capable of imposing on men of understanding, when, in truth, it is they who have imposed on themselves. - Their pride will not suffer them to imagine they could ever sustain a passion for a fool: so helping</p>

Tom is a mere adjective of society, for he cannot support himself one moment alone - nor is he ever so much as spoken of singly, but is tacked always to others, as Virgil introduces Thersilochus, with a copulative at the end of a line:</p> <p><note>Latin</note> - Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque,</p> <p>Chloreaque, Sybarimque, Daretaque, Thersilochumque.</p>

The many, various, and absurd systems of religion, reported from the most antient histories of the several parts of the world, appear to amount almost to a proof, that there must have been some sort of revelation originally made to our first parents; which, handed down to posterity, by oral tradition, or, at best, by types and hieroglyphics, received such alterations and corruptions, through the mistakes, the weaknesses, or sinister arts of man, as made it terminate in downright idolatry among the ignorant, and in atheism with the learned</p>
            <pb n="2:92" xml:id="pb-2:92" facs="#i328"/>
               <p> - to a certain pitch of error and presumption.</p> <p>For had there not been any revelation at all, there would either have been no sort of religion int he world, or a more rational one. - For, in that case, it must have been deduced, by tracing effects up to their causes, as far as the philosophy of the age in which this should have happened, might have been able to have reached. - And then - Deus intersit. - <note>Latin</note> So that the natural philosopher, and the moral reasoner, both joined in one, must have become a theist.</p> <p>But this probably could never have been the origin of religion, for the following reason - That this philosophic research must have happened in later times than those, in which history informs us the many fantastic</p>
            <pb n="2:93" xml:id="pb-2:93" facs="#i329"/>
               <p>modes of antient worship had been professed among all the nations of the earth, even the most illiterate, ignorant, and barbarous, who never could have taken up the least notion of religion from their own premises or conclusions.</p> <p>145. There are two sorts of moral writers. - The one represents human nature in an angelic light, and the other is a beastly one. - The first are generally found among the antients; and the latter intirely among the moderns - chiefly the French.</p> <p>They are both wrong. - One argues from the best, and the other from the worst, of our species. Doctor Young has a just sentiments, in his Centaur, which reconciles these different writers - "We cannot think too highly</p>
            <pb n="2:94" xml:id="pb-2:94" facs="#i330"/>
               <p>of our natures, nor too meanly of ourselves."</p> <p>146. A Montaigniana,</p> <p>Or a wandering thought, after the manner of Montaigne:</p> <p>While a man is reading or thinking abstractedly, he is king for the time - as being quite free from any manner of reflexion regarding his own circumstances. - Indeed, how seldom is it in the day that he feels the difference between himself and a king?</p> <p>Monarchs are unhappier than their subjects. - For use makes state familiar, and the fatigue grows every day more irksome. - Has opulence or grandeur then no advantages? None - but the power of doing good.</p>

               <p>I have often been surprized that so little of this kind of manufacture is ever wrought by princes, when the very rarity of the work might serve to render their names famous to posterity.</p> <p>"And paid a tradesman once, to make him stare."</p> <p>But away with all ambition, which only affects our names, without improving our natures.</p> <p>147. A moral, after the manner of Rochefaucault, and others of that stamp of immoral writers, who, in all their philosophic reflexions, endeavour to depreciate human nature:</p> <p>As our bodies are compounded of different elements, so are minds of various passions. - And as the blending of the former creates the</p>
            <pb n="2:96" xml:id="pb-2:96" facs="#i332"/>
               <p>union of body, so is all virtue produced by the balancing or commixing of the several affections and propensities of the soul.</p> <p>As our bodies are formed of clay, so are even our virtues made up of meanness or vice. - Add vain-glory to avarice, and it rises to ambition. - Lust inspires the lover, and selfish wants the friend. - Prudence is created by fear, and courage arises from madness, or from pride.</p> <p>148. A reflexion, on the decens et decorum, in morals: <note>Latin</note></p> <p>A friend of mine distrained a tenant's cattle for rent, then took them out of the pound, and put them on his own demesne to graze. The arrear was discharged in a day or two. - The stock was surrendered,</p>
            <pb n="2:97" xml:id="pb-2:97" facs="#i333"/>
               <p>but the tenant was charged for their grass.</p> <p>There appears certainly to be nothing contrary to law or moral, nor the lest sort of oppression or extortion in this matter. It was equal to the tenant, whether he had paid for grazing to the landlord, or the pound-keeper. - Then what can it be, that strikes one so strongly with the idea of a difference?</p> <p>There must surely be a want of decency in this action. - And though it may be, perhaps, too refined a speculation, to trace the subtile connection between them, yet I think that want of decency offends, by implying, in some sort, a deficiency of moral. It certainly does of that refined moral which Prior hints at:</p>
            <pb n="2:98" xml:id="pb-2:98" facs="#i334"/>
               <p>"Beyond the fix'd and settled rules</p> <p>Of vice and virtue in the schools," &amp;c.</p> <p>If decorum be not of the substance of virtue, it is at least one of its accidents. It is an adjective, which depends upon some moral for its substantive. - It is the round, the full, the fair, of the great circle *. Or it may be compared to the fine essence of light, that must have some solid matter for its subject, upon which it reflects all the beauty of colours.</p> <p>149. The mind is naturally active, and will employ itself ill, if you do not employ it well. Magicians tell us, that when they raise the devil, they must find him work - and that he will as readily build a church as pull one down.</p> <p>* See Prior's tale of Protogenes and Apelles.</p>

               <p>150. It is in what the world reckon trifles that a good understanding should most employ itself. - Great occasions generally direct their own operations, and but seldom occur - while every day's experience presents you with small cares sufficient to exercise your utmost prudence upon. - Therefore,</p> <p>"Think nought a trifle, though it small appear - </p> <p>Small sands the mountain - moments make the year - </p> <p>And trifles life. - Your care to trifles give,</p> <p>Or you may die - before you learn to live."</p> <p>YOUNG.</p> <p>151. I think that a person may as well be asleep - for they can be only said to dream - who read any thing, but with a view of improving their morals, or regulating their conduct.</p>

               <p>152. Nothing in this life, after health and virtue, is more estimable than knowledge - nor is there any thing so easily attained, or so cheaply purchased - the labour only sitting still, and the expence but time, which if we do not spend, we cannot save.</p> <p>153. If time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not using it, there might be some excuse for the idleness of half the world - but yet not a full one. - For even this would be such an oeconomy, as the living on a principal sum, without making it purchase interest.</p> <p>154. There are three ways of dealing with time - losing it, spending it, or putting it out to use.</p> <p>Ampliat aetatis spatium sibi, vir bonus - hoc est Vivere bis, vitÃ¢ poffe priore frui. - <note>Latin</note></p>

One of the fathers compares contemplation and action to Rachel and Leah. - The first was fairest, but the latter more fruitful.</p> <p>I am afraid he was not quite orthodox, by the wit of his simile.</p> <p>156. To the many difficult conceits of the antients, for the cramp of wit - such as poems cut out into the shapes of hearts, altars, wings, &amp;c. I would encumber literature with a fancy of my own invention - which, if it should once obtain - as, from the futility of it, there can hardly be a doubt - may be stiled the double boutrimÃ© - because the last word in every line is always made to chime to the first, throughout the poem - which takes off from the constraint of couplets, and joins the strength of blank</p>

               <p>PREFACE.</p> <p>GREGORIO Leti wrote as many books as he was years old. Homer divided the Iliad and the Odyssey into as many books as there are letters in the Greek alphabet. Herodotus numbered his books after the muses. And if ever Wilkes should commence an author, he will never stop, probably, till he has published volumes forty-five.</p> <p>From all which premises, I think it must appear pretty plain to the intelligent reader, that Tria Juncta in Uno <note>Latin</note> ought to divide his work into</p>

               <p>three parts, in allusion to his name - which you see I have accordingly done.</p> <p>And for this reason I make not the least manner of scruple to prefer myself before all and every of the above named authors - not only on account of my work being so much shorter than any of theirs, but principally in compliment to the number three, which you know - or ought to know - to be the completest sum in arithmetic.</p> <p>To odd numbers, in general, the antients attributed certain charms or powers - but three stands the foremost of them all - as it is the first that is capable of the act or potency of multiplication.</p>

One, two, three, and away, was the note for starting at the Olympic races. And the antients used to call thrice upon every corpse, to know if it could start any objection to its being interred.</p> <p>Which naturally leads me to Hades, or Ades, the old-fashioned region of distribution, according to our good or bad deeds. It consisted of three provinces - Erebus, Tartarus, and Elysium - Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory.</p>

John Weaver, in his history of antient monumnets, published in the year 1630, quotes the following prophecy from an holy anchorite in king Ethelred's time:</p> <p>"Englyshmen, for as much as they use to dronkelewnes, to treason, and to rechlessness of Goddes hous, first by Danes, and then by Normans, and atte thirde time by Scottes, they shall be overcome."</p> <p>5.

In hilly countries, the elastic spring of that element communicates a certain shrillness, or sharp accent, to whatever sound it reverberates. In Wales, the dogs bark with an ear-piercing tone - and perhaps with a brogue, as Mrs. Digherty says, in Ireland.</p> <p>6. The last words that Nero uttered, after he had done but justice on himself, were - O what an excellent harper dies this day!</p> <p>7.

In the Rabbinical account of the Jewish trials and punishments for adultery, there is one very curious particular:</p> <p>They gave the woman a potion, composed by the priest, called aqua zelotypiae, <note>Latin</note> or the water of jealousy. - If she had been guilty, it poisoned her forthwith - without benefit of clergy. But if innocent, it increased her health and fruitfulness. - What fine juggling there must have been here!</p> <p>And if the husband happened to have been guilty, in the same way himself, the draught had no ill effect</p>

Inter se <note>Latin</note> is an idiom, in the Latin, which signifies, from each other; though both the grammar and dictionary of that language would render it, among themselves - which is the very reverse.</p> <p>16.

               <p>This cannot be imitation - For the most illiterate parent, nurse, or servant, always say I.</p> <p>17. The antients have depicted Cupid and Somnus so alike, that they are not to be distinguished, but by their emblems.</p> <p>Surely they could not mean, by this equivocation, that love was but a dream, which vanishes into air, as soon as we awaken to our senses.</p> <p>18. The devil is Milton's hero. - Ovid seems to have been as partial to the old giants.</p> <p>19.

Spence says also, that Statius describes Minos and Aeacus sitting in judgment, to assist Pluto - and adds, but it must have been only occasionally.</p> <p>21. Adad was the greatest of the Assyrian gods. - Is this what we mean, when we swear adad?</p> <p>22. Lord Kaims, in his Elements of Criticism, hints, that brutes might become rational, if the use of speech was communicated to them. - Pray, are parrots or magpies rational?

The expression in Shakespeare, of sack and sugar, is not so absurd as it sounds. - Put sugar to sack, and it gives it a brisk, lively flavour, that cures it of that heavy, luscious taste, which it has in its own nature.</p> <p>25. Sir Isaac Newton was mistaken in his philosophy of vegetables being nourished by moisture. It is only the vehicle. - The pabulum, or incrementum, <note>Latin</note> is received from the earth.</p> <p>I am sorry that his postulatum is not true. - It would have destroyed the assertion of the atheists, that this world was from all eternity. - Had plants taken their augment from moisture, and then perished into</p>

Therefore the Mosaic history, of the world's having been made in time, must have been true.</p> <p>It might also have suggested a philosophical proof of this world's being finally to be destroyed by fire. - For heat will increase, in proportion to the decrease of moisture.</p> <p>26. A certain Venetian, a person of polite learning and fine taste, was so struck with the refined difference between Catullus and Martial, in their epigrams, that he used to perform an annual ceremony in his library, on each returning day of Catullus's mortuity, in which he sacrificed a volume of Martial's works to the manes of his favourite author.</p>

               <p>27. It has been remarked, that men are often most strongly attached to women who have not one valuable or amiable quality to recommend them. - The argument for which must then be, that if a man happens to fall in love without any reason, he can never have any reason for ceasing to love.</p> <p>28. George has lately obtained a peerage. - He was little, but would be less - so purchased a title, and became more contemptible.</p> <p>29. Fish-women cry Noble oysters. - They certainly are full as noble as any family blazoned out in Collins's peerage. - If not of as antient an house, of as old a bed at least. - And to shew their richness too, pearls and they are congenial.</p>

               <p>30. The deriving of families from antient times, merely from the sound or similarity of names, as is done in all books of heraldry, puts me in mind of Swift's conceit, in proving the antiquity of bees, from the Hivites, a race of people mentioned in the Old Testament.</p> <p>31. The Jews were the first nation upon record who introduced an attention to genealogy. - They had a reason for it, both in their law and in their gospel. - But after the coming of our Saviour, one should conclude all such superstition to have been at an end - as St. Paul says, "Neither give heed to fables, and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifyings." - And again - "But avoid foolish questions and genealogies."</p>

               <p>32. The Beggar's Opera was written in order to run down the Italian ones. - But it is of late become the object of its own ridicule. - They have so carbonaded and fritterellied it, that it is now neither one thing nor the other - an English, nor an Italian opera. - They are, at length, become allies, and hobble en pair.</p> <p>33. The circumstance of Robert discovering his father, William the Conqueror, at an engagement in Normandy, just as he was going to kill him, their reconciliation in the sight of both armies, &amp;c. would be a fine situation for an affecting tragedy.</p> <p>34.

               <p>one the best, but accepted of the eldest, merely to save her the mortification of having a younger sister preferred before her.</p> <p>This is a fine story, by way of test, to try the force of sentiment in others. The question happened to be proposed to me once in this way. - I approved of the generosity of the act, but had the modesty to answer it only by saying, that a person ought to be ashamed to differ in opinion from so great a man, in any action of his life.</p> <p>35. Tacitus gives the character of a man, magis extra vitiis, quam cum virtutibus. - <note>Latin</note> This expression is by no means just, in a strict sense; for it is a vice to be void of virtues. Dum satis putant vitio carere, in id ipsum incidunt vitium, quod virtutibus carent,</p>

               <p>says Quintilian, who was not only an excellent critic, but a sound moralist.</p> <p>Tacitus has many beauties in his writings, but would sacrifice any thing to the framing of an antithesis. Sallust and others among the antients had the same passion.</p> <p>36. Locke says, that wit and judgment rarely meet in the same person; because that their talents are directly opposite - the first collecting together all ideas which are any way alike - and the latter employed in separating those which in any particular differ.</p> <p>Methinks there is more wit than judgment in this remark. - For the same quickness which can form an assemblage, is as nimble at distinguishing. - The proverb is not unapplicable</p>

               <p>here, those who hide can find.</p> <p>37. In the ninth book of Pope's Iliad, there is a note on the 494th line, where I think that both Eustathius and he have mistaken the sense.</p> <p>When Achilles says that he despises Agamemnon, like a Carian, he seems to hint that he must have had as venal a soul as the people of Caria - a nation of Boeotia, that used to hire out troops, like the modern Swiss - to think that he could be bribed to battle by the presents he offers.

Od. 17.</p> <p>Please to observe here, that Paddy Horace says his friend is part of himself; and that if this same part should be taken away, the remainder - altera - would not be the whole - integer.</p> <p>Now if any modern author had written the above passage, would not the English critics stiled it an Hibernicism?</p> <p>39.

               <p>You see that the deficiency is by this means supplied in the first part, and the abundance rescinded in the latter.</p> <p>40. Pere Rapin says, very justly, of most of the Italian writers, that they strive rather to say things witily, than naturally. - But both French and English authors have frequently the same fault.</p> <p>Look back to number 35, for the commencement of this vicious stile of writing.</p> <p>41. The Apollo Belvidere is confessedly the finest statue in the known world. - How could the very ingenious Mr. Spence, in his Polymetis, mistake his figure and expression, just after having slain the Python, for a simple Apollo Venator?</p>

               <p>42.

In philosophy it is said, that eunuchs bear wine better than men do. - The philosopher then who claimed the prize of drinking, for being the first drunk, did honour to his gender.</p> <p>Listen to this, ye jovial country squires, and never boast again of being able to carry off a greater quantity of liquor - I think that is the phrase - than other men.</p> <p>44.

There be six things, in physic, stiled non-naturals. - And what do you think the are? Even the most natural things in nature - diet - evacuation - air - exercise - sleeping - and waking.</p> <p>47. In the Harleian Miscellany, volume the first, and page first - the preamble - there is this expression: - "To shew that when God is on our side, neither the power, nor the policy of man, is able to do us harm." - What a deep reflexion!

The capitol of Rome was so called, because that a man's head - which might have been a woman's, for aught they knew - the gender does not lie there - happened to have been dug out of the foundation.</p> <p>From this hint, the Augurs prophesied, that Rome should become the capital of the world. - You may see what sort of reasoners priests must have been from the beginning.</p> <p>Rome was stiled also the mistress, not the master of the world. - Which seems sufficiently to justify my surmise, above hinted, about the head.</p> <p>49.

The Lex Papia forbad men to marry after sixty, and women after fifty.</p> <p>I think the law was wrong in the first article - because men may have children, long after that age - or their wives may, at least, which answers as well for the community. - But matrimony is generally thrown away upon any woman after Wilkes's number.</p> <p>To have children, is the only modest reason a woman can give for marriage. - And after such pretence has ceased, what an indecent thing must</p>

Diotima, a female philosopher, was the person that initiated Socrates into the philosophia amatoria, which the Platonists afterwards extolled so highly.</p> <p>63. Theano, another female philosopher, used to advise married women to lay aside shame with their cloaths.</p> <p>This brothel-maxim is finely reprehended by the chaste Plutarch, who says, that women ought never to be</p>

Hucheson, in his philosophic treatise on beauty, harmony, and order, plus's and minus's you to heaven or hell, by algebraic equations - so that none but an expert mathematician can ever be able to settle his accounts with St. Peter - and perhaps St. Matthew, who had been an officer in the customs, must be called in to audit them.</p> <p>71.

Brutus was originally a name of contempt, given first to Lucius Junius, by Tarquin, on account of his pretending madness and folly, in order to escape the notice and jealousy of that tyrant, who had put his father and brother to death.</p>

Margaret de Valois, queen of Navarre, was stiled a tenth muse, and a fourth grace.</p> <p>77. Solon said, that if all men were to cast their misfortunes into one common heap, every person would rather take up his own lot again, than accept an equal share with the rest.</p> <p>This is an odd expression - for as he makes the reflection general, it is as much as to say, in effect, that every one's evils were less when put in, and greater when taken out. This might be true of some, but could not possibly be so of all.</p>

               <p>79. Plato said of Dionysius's court, at his return from Sicily, on his being asked what he observed remarkable there - Vidi monstrum in naturÃ¢, hominem bis saturatum in die. <note>Latin</note> - By saturatum he meant merely eating, not drinking.</p> <p>What would he have said, had he lived in modern times, and seen not only two meals, but two debauches, in the same day!</p> <p>80. In the life of Henry prince of Wales, there is a curious story told, of a speech made by a pope, who silenced a priest for preaching doctrines contrary to the catholic faith.</p> <p>The man defended himself, by saying that he had advanced nothing but the gospel, and the word of God. - To which his holiness replied, that this was, in effect, to subvert the catholic religion.</p>

It is reported of Sebastian, a very good Latin poet, that he could seldom avoid speaking in verse, in his common conversation.</p> <p>In general, warm people, as poets, naturally are, speak usually in blank verse - except they stutter.</p> <p>"I lisp'd in numbers - for the numbers came."</p> <p>86. The Count de Bonarelli, and Italian nobleman, had passed through a regular course of divinity and philosophy, and distinguished himself in both these studies.</p> <p>He was afterwards taken from those pursuits, and employed by the great duke of Ferrara, in sixteen</p>

The covetous man is poor - but the contented one rich - said Bias the philosopher.</p> <p>88. Solon built a city in Cilicia, which he named Soleis, and peopled it with a colony from Athens; who mixing with the natives of the country, corrupted their language, and were said to solaecise. - Diogenes Laertius</p>

Simonides, a very sweet Greek poet, was so affected about the nicety of his expression, that being to mention mules, upon some occasion, he stiled them daughters of mares. - Upon which Diogenes rallied him, by asked whether they were not daughters of asses as well.</p> <p>90. In Plato's Phedon, Socrates says, that while the soul is immersed in matter, it staggers, strays, frets, and is giddy, like a man in drink.</p> <p>There is a passage in the Psalms, from whence one must be almost certain he must have borrowed this image - They reel too and fro, and stagger, like a drunken man, and are at their wits end.

               <p>Here, not only the simile is the same, and the expression almost so - as near as different translations of the same text, not performed by the Septuagint, can be supposed to approach - but the very occasions are parallel also. The first described the state of the soul, under the incumbrances of corporeal affections, and the latter speaks of men unassisted by grace.</p> <p>91. Plato allowed mirth and wine to old men, but forbad them both to young ones. To be merry and wise, might have been a proverb deduced from this law.</p> <p>But Plato's reason was truly philosophic - that while our natural chearfulness and spirits remain, we should never use incitements. To spur a free horse, soon makes a jade of him.</p>

It is only what may be stiled a capable truth. - Virtue will not be sufficient - for example alone won't do. The king must have both sense and spirit too. He should let all his bounties, honours, and preferments, flow in one chaste channel, and, like heaven, bribe us to our good.</p> <p>93. It is not an amazing thing, that men shall attempt to investigate the mystery of the redemption, when, at the same time that it is propounded to us as an article of faith solely, we are told, that the very angels have desired to pry into it in vain?</p>

The maresÃ§hal de Bellegarde was a lover, and a favourite of Anne of Austria's, but happened to be discarded upon the following occasion:</p> <p>When he was taking leave of her majesty, to repair to his command in the army, he solicited her, with an air of passion and mystery, to give him her hand; which after she had, with a blush, some hesitation, and turning aside her head,</p>

               <p>"With neck retorted, and oblique regard,"</p> <p>at length consented to, he applied it immediately to the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>A most stupid piece of old-fashioned gallantry, to be sure. - But observe, at the same time, the unaccountable caprice of woman, in his dismissal.</p> <p>98. Plutarch has a fine expression, with regard to some woman of learning, humility, and virtue - That her ornaments were such as might be purchased without money, and would render any woman's life both glorious and happy.</p> <p>99.

Another fragment in favour of the sex:</p> <p>It is remarkable, that as by a woman we were all undone, so by a woman we were all retrieved again.</p> <p>For as the Virgin conceived without the co-operation of man, all the human nature that Christ took upon himself, must have been derived intirely from the feminine gender.</p> <p>101. The Laplanders have odd notions. They encourage the killing of bears in their country; and have framed this law, that any man who destroys one, shall be exempted from cohabiting with his wife for a week - and so on, toties quoties.</p>

               <p>102. Heraclitus was the person who first introduced the burning of the dead, upon this philosophy, that fire was the predominant principle of all things; and that by such dissolution, the aethereal flame, or soul of man, was better and sooner purified and disunited from the grossness of matter.</p> <p>103. The doctors of the Sorbonne, in the year 1550, caused a priest to be deprived of his benefice, for pronouncing the words quisquis and quanquam, as they are spelled, <note>Latin</note> instead of kiskiss and kankam, as they had reformed them. - Which were the greater fools, they, or the priest?</p> <p>104. Sophocles has written a tragedy, which consists of but one intire monologue, of a person complaining</p>

Pythagoras was the person who first changed the arrogant appellation of sophos, or wise man, to philosopher, or a lover of wisdom. </p> <p>107. What a savage race of men must the antient Romans have been, who had but one word, hostis, <note>Latin</note> in their language, for an enemy and a foreigner?</p> <p>108.

Sir Isaac Newton standing by the side of a quarry, saw a stone fall from the top of it, to the ground. - "Why should this stone, when loosened from its bed, rather descend, than rise, or fly across? Either of these directions must have been equally indifferent to the stone itself."</p> <p>Such was his soliloquy; and this the first philosophic reflexion he had ever made. This led him first into considering the nature of gravity, &amp;c. - So that to a mere accident we owe all those deep researches, and useful</p>

Plutarch imputes the ceasing of many of the oracles, to the world's being thinner peopled at the time than formerly. - "The gods, says he, would not deign to use so many interpreters of their wills, to so small an handful of people."</p> <p>112. Solon was the person who granted a power to parents of putting their children to death. - Who was in that gave them authority to condemn their daughters to a nunnery?</p> <p>113. Plutarch commends Attalus for destroying all his own children, in order to leave his wealth and kingdom to his nephew.</p>

               <p>One unnatural action induced another. - For Attalus's reason for so doing was, that his brother, the father of that nephew, had left him his heir, in wrong to his own son.</p> <p>114. Men affect parrots, that disgrace human speech - and are fond of monkies, that ridicule human action.</p> <p>115. Great eaters have generally but dull intellects. - The dromedary is said to have four stomachs.</p> <p>116. A very curious and authentic letter has been lately brought to light, from the queen of Scots to Elizabeth - which makes the latter's chastity not to be so problematical a point as general history had left it to us.

Mr. Spence, in his Polymetis, says, that there must have been a nymph, whose name was Aura - or Procris could never have conceived a jealousy at the expression of Cephanlus, Aura veni. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>How could a person of his taste, and excellent criticism, possibly make so poor a comment! This passage certainly does not, in the least, prove that there ever was such a nymph, but only that Procris imagined there was.</p> <p>Had he remembered Shakespeare, he would have known, that</p> <p>"Trifles light as air, are, to the jealous,</p> <p>Confirmations strong," &amp;c.</p>

               <p>119. Mr. Spence is shamefully mistaken in another passage too. He says that the Hamadryads were not reputed by the poets to have been the souls of particular trees, but the nymphs of the woods in general.</p> <p>But these latter were always distinguished by the title of Dryads, from whence Druids, and the former were only thought to be the lives of trees.</p> <p>120. The seeing an object distinctly, with one eye, and the not seeing it double, with two, must appear to be an unaccountable circumstance in vision. - The same philosophic question may be applied to hearing.</p> <p>121.

I was acquainted once with a gallant soldier, who assured me that his only measure of courage was this:</p> <p>Upon the first fire, in an engagement, he immediately looked upon himself as a dead man. He then bravely fought out the remainder of the day, perfectly regardless of all manner of danger, as becomes a dead man to be.</p> <p>So that all the life or limbs he carried back again to his tent, he reckoned as clear gains - or, as he himself expressed it, so much saved out of the fire.</p> <p>123. A man is shorter, standing up, than lying along. He is certainly</p>

Peculiarities in Clarke's Latin grammar:</p> <p>He reckons but seven parts of speech, leaving out the pronoun and participle, and substituting the adjective for both.</p> <p>He admits only five cases of nouns, rejecting the vocative. - His reason for this curious. - See the note, page I.</p> <p>The order of his cases too stands thus: - Nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and ablative.</p> <p>125. About the middle of the thirteenth century, and in the pontificate of Gregory the Ninth, a curious incident happened.</p> <p>Count Gleichen was taken prisoner, in an engagement against the Saracens,</p>

               <p>and condemned to slavery. He was employed at work in the gardens of the seraglio, and happened to be taken notice of by the Sultan's daughter. - She found out that he was a person of distinction, conceived a passion for him, and offered to contrive his escape, if he would marry her.</p> <p>He honestly told her that he had a wife already. - She replied, that she made no manner of scruple of that circumstance, as the custom of her country allowed men a plurality. Upon these terms then they agreed, and had the fortune to get safe together to Venice. He hastened to Rome, made Gregory acquainted with the particulars of the story, and upon promise to make Miss Saracen turn Catholic, obtained a dispensation to keep both wives.</p>
            <pb n="2:175" xml:id="pb-2:175" facs="#i411"/>
               <p>The first wife was so much rejoiced at recovering her husband, upon any conditions, that she acquiesced in the articles, and shewed herself grateful, in the highest instance, to his fair deliverer. The story mentions another unnatural circumstance also in this matter - that the Saracen had no children, but shewed a mother's fondness toward those of her rival. - What pity that she did not leave some of her breed behind her!</p> <p>At Gleichen they still continue to shew the bed in which they all three used to sleep peaceably together - which, for that reason, might more properly be stiled the grave.</p> <p>They were all buried in the same tomb, in the church of the Petersberg Benedictines, and lie under a stone, with this epitaph, which the count,</p>
            <pb n="2:176" xml:id="pb-2:176" facs="#i412"/>
               <p>who outlived them both, ordered to be inscribed upon it:</p> <p>"Here lie the bodies of two rival wives, who with unparalleled affection loved each other as sisters, and me extremely. The one fled from Mahomet, to follow her husband - the other was willing to embrace the spouse she had recovered. - United by the ties of matrimonial love, we had, when living, but one nuptial bed; and in our deaths, only one marble to cover us."</p> <p>126. Plato describes two Cupids - a celestial, and a terrestrial one. - Perhaps he meant thus to divide the antient opinion of the two urchins, who are said one to cause, and the other to cease, love - or, more likely,</p>

               <p>to distinguish platonic love from the natural one.</p> <p>127. Sir Francis Bacon says, the muses are in league together with time, and preserve the privileges of the golden age. - Poetry subsists after states and empires are lost. The poet's life unites safety with dignity, pleasure with merit - I wish I could add profit also - and bestows admiration without envy. - It places a man in the feast, and not in the throng - in the light, but not in the heat.</p> <p>128. It was said, very justly, and refinedly, by a lady, mentioned in one of Swift's letters, that in men, desire begets love - and in women, love begets desire.</p> <p>129.

In Comus, speaking of midnight shout and revelry, upon joyful occasions, Milton justly says, they thanked the gods amiss.</p> <p>132. A man must be born a school-master. He must be more or less than man, says Le Sage, in his Bachelor of Salamanca, to preserve his patience.</p> <p>133.

How imperfect must the state of orthography have been, when there was no more different between the numerals that express four, and two hundred, than 7 and 7!</p> <p>145.

The emperor Adrian, who wrote the familiar versicles to his soul, and was a person of surprizing knowledge and literature, for a king, preferred Cato to Cicero, and Ennius to Virgil.</p> <p>148.

Constantius, the last of the pagan Roman emperors, and father of Constantine the Great, died also at York.</p> <p>150.

               <p>I think that such a supplement is much wanted in our own constitution. How can a female culprit be said to be tried by her peers, without a female jury? But upon all indictments for ravishment, particularly, I would have women only impanelled. - For the business, upon such occasions, ought undoubtedly to be, rather to examine the accuser, than to try the accused.</p> <p>Now girls often give themselves great airs about being ravished, though nothing might have been farther from their thoughts at the time. They might perhaps have been so, in a natural sense, though not in a legal one - which is all I pretend to contend for.

And a man ought only to be condemned upon the first category. - For if the fact itself should be thought sufficient to convict him, his holiness the pope himself must infallibly suffer.</p> <p>151. In the fourteenth century, one Nicolao Gabrini di Rienzi, one of the lowest of the people of Rome, had spirit and ambition enough to conceive a design of compassing the sovereignty of the city - and without</p>

Pope Julius the Second was reading the Bible, when an account was brought to him of his troops being beaten by the French. - Upon which, he threw down the book on the floor, out of resentment to the partiality of heaven.</p> <p>156.

Stephen Barthorius, a king of Poland, said, that God had reserved three things to himself - the power of creation, the knowledge of future events, and the dominion over our consciences.</p> <p>158. The Romans were a wicked people in their public policy, though virtuous in their private morals. They made use of the basest, most oppressive, and most cruel methods of aggrandizing their empire - by subjecting all their neighbours to the</p>

The punica sides <note>Latin</note> of the Carthaginians was never so great, as the faithlesness and treachery of the Romans.</p> <p>159. Antient Rome rendered herself mistress - which is worse than master - of the world, under her consuls, by the same methods that she continued so afterwards under her popes.</p> <p>The good of the commonwealth, was the former pretext - and the good of the church, was the latter one. - These being their first principles, to which all others were to be subordinate, whatever vice, falsehood, or oppression, that could favour either of these</p>

It was lucky, and worthy of remark, that just when the Greek and Roman story had risen to the highest pitch of personal heroism, glory, virtue, and example - and that history had been in full possession of the facts - their languages should fall suddenly into corruption and decay, by the destruction of their empires, so as to become dead ones.</p> <p>It is by this means that they have obtained to become classical studies, and we read their authors universally, or universitally, at least, with pleasure and improvement - which it had been impossible to have done, had those tongues, like the living ones, continued still to have been altered, commixed,</p>

Boyle, in his Seraphic Love, says, "Our Saviour is so near unto God, that he might well have said, I and the Father are one." - By which he seems to have thought, that Christ spoke only figuratively in such expressions.</p> <p>Boyle had studied the Scriptures, both as a commentator and divine. - Nay, in the beginning of the twentieth section of this very work, he expresly says, "that he had had taken some pains in the study of controversial divinity."</p> <p>His abilities were great, and his sense of religion warm - so that, both</p>

               <p>as an enthusiast and a theologist, he would probably have delivered himself more Athanasianly, if he had not been restrained, both as a metaphysician and an expositor.</p> <p>162. Lewis the Thireeenth took particular notice of De Retz, afterwards cardinal, for his generosity and virtue in placing a girl in a convent, who had been sold to him by her mother; as also for his bravery in desiring his antagonist to take up his sword again, which he had dropt, on his foot slipping, in a duel with him.</p> <p>The attending to such instances of magnanimity and virtue, in private life, is the being a king. This is the only way that a monarchy can be said to be preferable to a commonwealth.</p>

               <p>As this is the most charming prerogative with which princes are endowed, I am surprized that they are not fond of exerting it oftener than they do, during their abundant leisure. - For, like Lucretius's gods, they generally leave the affairs of the world to take care of themselves, under the agency of but second-best causes - or the direction of chance, not choice - and their ministers take care, or don't take care, of all the business of state, without ever troubling them - till after it is done - or undone.</p> <p>163. Doctor Young said, that Pope had put Achilles into petticoats again - alluding, I suppose, to his first disguise among the daughters of Lycomedes, and to the fetters of rhime.</p>

               <p>164. What has surprized me most in history, is to read of so few kings who have abdicated their thrones - Not above a dozen or two at the most!</p> <p>165. I shirted myself this morning the moment I got out of bed. - There happened to be a large pier glass just before me, which exposed me to myself, stark naked. I had never, in all my life, seen such a sight before.</p> <p>I am subject to reflexions, and stood, for near a minute, philosophizing on my figure, with my arms a kembo, resembling, both in shape and complexion, one of your new-fashioned brown Dutch tea kitchens - but alas! without a salamander.</p> <p>Upon a close scrutiny on all my parts, I could fairly account for every inch, member, or circumstance about</p>

               <p>me, except my nipples. - The horse, the bull, the ram - nor even the baboon, which comes nearest the man - have them not. - No other male animal of the creation is incumbered with such parts, as actually appear to be of no more use to me than they are to the lady mothers, mentioned in chapter xxxiii.</p> <p>166. A solution of the three riddles mentioned in number 135:</p> <p>O ciel! donne Ã  mon coeur des forces suffisantes,</p> <p>Pour pouvoir supporter des douleurs si cuisantes.</p> <p>O mihi tam longae maneat pars ultima vitae,</p> <p>Spiritus, et quantum sat erit tua dicere facta!</p><note>Latin</note> <p>Fear first made gods, the impious atheist cries - </p> <p>And fear unmade them, the divine replies.</p> <p>You can easily see the contrivance of it. - The initials only of each word are set down, and a dot made for every letter in it.</p>

               <p>I here make a present of this mystery to the public, for the benefit of the press. It will be a much better method of designing names that one dares not print out, than the common way of A-, B-, &amp;c.</p> <p>As for example: - Suppose you had been abusing a corrupt minister, till you were tired - but indeed, right or wrong, they are all abused - and then were to conclude your spite, with saying, the man I mean is S-, how readily might one mistake this for Sandwich? But were it wrote thus, S------, the obloquy would be obviated - nor would the candid public suffer malignity to avail itself of the old quibble, h non est litera - <note>Latin</note> while the decypherer would soon end the dispute, by construing it into Sejanus.</p>

An explanation of the inscription, in number 136:</p> <p><note>Latin</note> Quos anguis tristi diro cum vulnere stravit,</p> <p>Hos sanguis Christi miro tum munere lavit.</p> <p>By comparing these two passages together, you may see how artfully the middle line of the former is made up from parts of the first, which serve equally to answer to the fragments of the latter. - Difficiles nugae.</p> <p>168. Female vanity. - Even Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, is said to have cast away her pipe, upon being told by her maids of honour that it used to discompose her features - and would never suffer herself to be served, as all the other goddesses had so notoriously been, for fear of spoiling her shape.</p>

               <p>169. A friend of mine once had conceived a particular aversion to persons who had been born with red hair. He carried this strange prejudice to an extravagant length. - He used to say, that he could never confide in a friend or a mistress of this complexion - for that the men were false, and women frisky.</p> <p>An instance or two of this kind had determined his philosophy, with as much reason as the jockey, in an old story, had for the reverse - who having once met with a good horse, who happened to be cropt-eared, pronounced that cropt-eared horses were naturally good. - A barber too recommended white-hasted razors, from the same experience.</p> <p>Red hair is only a sign - if it be any sign at all - of warm or lively affections;</p>

In the Passion, painted by Michael Angelo, the Virgin is finely described, according to her peculiar circumstances - though certainly most absurdly, under the general idea of such a situation.</p> <p>She stands unmoved, and looking on the sufferings of her Son, without grief, without pity, without regret, without tears - because she is supposed</p>

               <p>Theocritus, translated by Creech.</p> <p>So that I cannot determine which might have been the plagiarist, by comparing their different aeras.</p> <p>Is not this a precious morsel for the critics? Let me conjecture about it. My opinion is, that Creech meant to have quoted Horace; and his memory failing him, he might have supplied the verse out of his own head - as is frequently the case, in repeating without book.</p> <p>My reason is this - Creech translated Horace, though badly; but must certainly have remembered the above passage in him - and I cannot suppose that he would have taken worse lines to the same purpose from any other writer.</p> <p>Now the verum, atquÃ¨ bonum, <note>Latin</note> in the latter distich, are, in strictness of</p>

               <p>philosophy, the same thing. - But there is a beautiful distinction between the verum, atquÃ¨ decens, in the first lines. <note>Latin</note> Horace joins manners with morals, and adds good-breeding to virtue.</p> <p>Perhaps the anonymous lines above quoted may be in Lucretius - I have read but little of him - from whom Horace is said to have borrowed not only his principles of the Epicurean philosophy, but to have taken several passages out of his writings - among which this may possibly be one, that he has improved.</p> <p>Creech translated both of these authors, and might naturally be supposed to have been partial to the one which he had the best success with.</p> <p>172.

               <p>simile for Homer to have applied to Ajax or Diomede - Which is it? for I will not take the trouble to look, though the Iliad lies now on my table.</p> <p>Madame Dacier defends the allusion to the ass, in such a way as deserves not a serious answer. - She had much better have agreed with Horace, and have ranked that simile under the head of</p> <p><note>Latin</note> Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</p> <p>173. Aristotle's Art of Poetry is the best esteemed piece of criticism among the antients. How came he to excel both Horace and Vida, though better poets, and who had also the advantage of studying him before they wrote?</p> <p>Because they only copied him - but he had copied nature. - All his</p>

               <p>rules, as Pere Rapin says, are but nature methodized, or reason reduced to art.</p> <p>174. Some of the altitudes or depths of philosophy, are, to doubt our senses, to discredit our own existence, and to require impossible demonstrations for self-evident propositions.</p> <p>175. The philosopher, I think it was Des Cartes, who, after a world of deep reflexion, said, Cogito, ergo sum, <note>Latin</note> might as well have said dubito, at first, and have deduced his ergo from thence at once. - For, in this case, to doubt, is to be certain.</p> <p>176.

               <p>not where to stop. - The whipping of Sancho, for the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and the twitching and pinking him, for the resurrection of Altisidora, are prophane allusions.</p> <p>In the latter manoeuvre, when one of the executioners pinches his face, he cries out, your fingers smell of vinegar. - "And they gave him a sponge, dipt in vinegar, to drink."</p> <p>In his last volume chapters xvii. and xix. he has a stroke at the church, who will not redeem or absolve gratis, as their master did. Why slept the holy inquisition all this while?</p> <p>177.

               <p>This is the way that libraries are filled! or rather stuffed. - I approve greatly of Master Triglyh's scheme for one, in chapter xcv. of the Triumvirate - though possibly my own works might have been excluded from it.</p> <p>178. By the canon law, if a cardinal be accused of fornication, there must be a septuagint of witnesses to prove it - So that he must kiss a girl at the market cross, at least, to be convicted. - How many more would be requisite to convict a pope?</p> <p>179. Socrates has framed an allegory, for pleasure, as allied to pain, that resembles Scriblerus's description of the Lindamira-Indamora. - For though their faces are turned different ways, there is no enjoying</p>

The antient philosophy materialized spirit, and the modern, in order to be even with it, has spiritualized matter. - What extremes are men liable to run into, who depart one line from common sense!</p> <p>182.
