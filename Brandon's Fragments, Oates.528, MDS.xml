             <p>ADDRESS</p> <p>TO THE</p> <p>SHADE OF YORICK.</p> <p>DEEM not, GENTLE SPIRIT! that, Presumption, which only wears Presumption's garb. If I have given language to beings of thy creation - my pen was not guided by vanity in doing so! - if thy "pen governed thee - not thou it," - my Spirits govern me - not I them. Warmed by thy native fire - thou hast conducted me through paths that thy "fancy has scattered over with rose-buds of delight." - Moved by MARIA'S piteous lesson on her pipe,</p>
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>I flew with thee from thy chaise - placed myself on the bank on which thou sattest with her - I saw thee dry her tears - then thy own - then hers - then steep thy handkerchief in thy own again. - And when thou askedst her, - what the likeness between thee and her goat - I saw thy reflection written on thy countenance*. - Alas! thought I - that maxim which tells us we are blind to errors of our own, may be further urged - We are sometimes blind even to our virtues. Yes! thou, Gentle YORICK! - thou, at that very moment, provedst how little thy feelings - so placid - so urbane - so much in unison with pity - how little they partook the nature of a brute. - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>I do intreat the candid Reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest conviction of what a beast Man is, that I asked the question. STERNE.</p>

             <p>I have followed my uncle Toby, and his faithful Trim, in the field - when their brows have been twined with laurel - or with cypress - or with myrtle - I have seen their advances - their retreats - their defeats - their victories - and their amours - their generosity - their simplicity - and their humanity. - I followed my uncle Toby to Le Fevre's bed-side; and saw him open the curtain with that frankness - "the cause, not the effect, of familiarity;" - and if, when that sweet youth knelt by the bed-side of his father - kissed the ring that hung suspended from his neck - and bathed his hand (which was waxing cold) with the innocent tears of a fond child - if then the tears that rolled down the cheek of my uncle Toby, in unison with young Le Fevre's, transmitted their dew upon my cheek - 'twas thou, Gentle YORICK! that touched my soul with sympathy.</p>
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>* I, too, mingled in the dance - where RELIGION, shaking the gloomy folds from her fore-head, stepped it hand in hand with MIRTH - her countenance open, free, and compressed; - and though her heart beat lightly - still was her eye inclined to Heaven, - while INNOCENCE and a glowing sun-set brightened up the scene. - I would rather see her thus engaged - or kneeling on a wheat-sheaf at an harvest-home, - than prostrate at an Altar carved and gilt by ART, singing Te Deum - <note>Latin</note> for a blood-stained Victory. - </p> <p>I have heard my father speculate how men might learn virtue - and seen my uncle Toby, and Trim - give an example how to practise it! - I have turned my head with honest</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* I thought I beheld Religion mixing in the dance.</p> <p>The Grace, Sentimental Journey.</p>

             <p>Toby, as he has been sitting at his supper - and detected Trim, in disobedience to the commands of his superior officer - standing behind his chair, instead of sitting - (Generous mutiny!) - My knee has been sympathised with Trim's knee - and my heart with Toby's heart; - for, in such moments, a sensation made up of pity, dash'd with a shade of anger, came across the feelings of my uncle Toby, and blunted his appetite. - My heart, with his, beat lighter and lighter, as Trim gradually seated himself; - and when Toby found his faithful and modest Trim was sitting - each mouthful, then, was certain to refresh him.</p> <p>BELOVED YORICK! - if, in reading thee, I learned to feel, - and, in feeling, to admire thee! - is it not one of the simplest movements of Nature - in admiring - I attempt to</p>
            <pb n="8" xml:id="pb-8" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>imitate thee? - Thus shelt'ring myself behind NATURE, (whom thou lovedst as tenderly as young Le Fevre loved his father) - I pray thy Spirit not to cast its gentle eye upon me, as on PRESUMPTION - but rather as one - who, in imitating thee, is but seeking to cultivate a closer knowledge - with the sources of thy feelings.</p>

             <p>WAR.</p> <p>A FRAGMENT.</p> <p> - THAT spirit - cried my father - which fired the Athenian soul when Aristides led forth his legions, seems to animate them: - they are fighting for glory! - They are fighting for Freedom, brother - quoth my uncle Toby, (wishing to set my father right.) - They are fighting for the evacuation of the body politic - exclaimed Doctor Slop. - They are magnanimous - cried my father. - They are brave - said my uncle Toby - They are Infidels - quoth Doctor Slop; - they have melted</p>

             <p>the blessed images of our Saints, and converted them into the wages of blasphemy: - they are Murderers! - they are Atheists! - They pay more worship to the GREAT BEING who made us - cried my uncle Toby - by defending the cause, and promoting the good of his creatures - than all the knees that ever bent to idols. - (Here Yorick entered the parlour) - </p> <p>They fight for Glory! - cried my father, raising his voice.</p> <p>Glory! - said Yorick, (while benevolence reddened on his countenance) - Glory blooms on the Olive! I never see a Laurel but methinks there's blood upon its leaf: - the Laurel springs near the Wolf, - the Olive is a shelter for the Lamb! To bind up the wounds of Affliction - to feed the Hungry - to make Woe forget her troubles - and Misery to smile - is Glory! It is Glory to shelter our fellow-creatures! - but</p>

             <p>AMBITION and RAPINE, retired behind the walls of their castles, level their engines of destruction on the heads of the Helpless; - myriads actuated by them, and blind to fear, rise with the Sun, and mingle with the blessed dews of Heaven, the blood of their fellow-creatures!</p> <p>I would not fight under such commanders - quoth Trim, (in a low voice to my uncle Toby, while standing beside him) - though I were to be made a General for it! - A corporal, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby - with Mercy at his side, and Valour in his heart, is a braver soul - Courage not guided by Humanity (continued he) is not the bravery of a Man, but the ferocity of a Savage. - An' so it is, an' please your Honour - replied Trim - Why, there's the long-whisker'd mercenaries, though a woman with her baby at her breast were to cry quarter, they wouldn't grant it. - They have more</p>

             <p>whiskers than pity, then - cried Yorick, smiling.</p> <p>I wish - cried my father, (looking stedfastly at Dr. Slop) - I wish that one example held out by this Nation of Plunderers and Atheists, may be followed in every other, - that the pleasure-grounds of Priests may be converted into the grounds of usefulness, where INDUSTRY may smile upon her plough, while the Dove resteth upon it.</p> <p>Here Doctor Slop was filled with inflammable matter: The holy ground of Priests - cried he - encroached upon! the Scriptures spurned at! the Cross despised! the Saints sneered at! - Religion! Religion! what will become of thee? - Time will improve it - quoth my uncle Toby, in the simplicity of his heart. - As if an electric shock had been conducted to the body of Doctor Slop, his movement could not have</p>

To an injury (he would say) that puts the means of my well-being or existence in alarm, I would apply the Laws of my Country. - INJURY is an assassin who levels his pistol at my head; but for INSULT, who is but a deserter from the ranks of Honour, my own bosom should</p>

             <p>youthful mind as the wax. - Or, to further illustrate my argument - continued my father - the mind may be compared to a camera-obscura, which takes in all the objects that are presented before it, and which become, as it were, drawn on the intellectual wall: - Now, Toby, if the prospect be a corrupt and vicious one, it follows of course, that the wall, as I have termed it, must receive the vice that is thrown upon it; - that is, Toby, the being impressed by bad example, must necessarily become vicious. - </p> <p>My dear brother - quoth my uncle Toby, (rubbing his had across his fore-head) - it never once entered my thoughts that vice was necessary!</p> <p> - Clearly so, (replied my father, in the rapidity of speculation) - for if a man, in a fit of provocation, were to seize his father by the throat - and, hurried on by a combination of</p>

When the Court were informed that the offence was capital, and that they must proceed to pass sentence, the Jury were so much alarmed, that they wished to reverse the verdict in such words as to make the consequence less than death; they adjourned the Court, and dispatched a messenger to Thomas Willard, Esq. </p>

When the message was made known to them, the Chief Baron jocosely said, "Instruct them to reverse the verdict, and bring it in Man-slaughter." A new verdict to that effect was the consequence.</p>

         <p>An' please your Honour - said Trim - he cannot hold out long! - Tell him, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby - that I am an old Soldier, who received a wound, - </p> <p> - What! - exclaimed ANNA, (with a look of frantic pity) - and were you kidnapped too? - No, my poor lass! - replied my uncle Toby - I went willingly to the Wars. - The profession of a Soldier is an honourable one - when it is honourably used - to resist Oppression, not support it. - It is meant as a shield to cover those who are not able to protect themselves. - Tell him - continued my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Trim - that my wound prevents my hazarding fatigue, or I should have had the honour of waiting on him myself. - But first attend me to the Inn, Trim, where I will wait thy return. - </p> <p>The Landlord of ANNA'S cottage was fortunately</p>

            <p>unlike the common run of those beings: - she owed her rent; - she was welcome to owe it! - </p> <p>My uncle Toby, at parting, tenderly kissed the Children; - the tears were in his eyes. - He gave ANNA - first his hand, and then his purse: - she received them both with that timid modesty - which a delicate mind commonly accepts with. - </p> <p>ANNA locked the door of her cottage - she fled to her Landlord - and immediately paid her rent. - </p> <p>ANNA was honest, too, amidst all her sorrows. - </p> <p> - Surely, with all these virtues, her Father will forgive her! - </p> <p> - Leave we Trim, enter'd on his new Commission. - </p>

            <p>ANNA.</p> <p>(CONCLUDED.)</p> <p>A FRAGMENT.</p> <p> - MY uncle Toby was now seated at the fire side, with his pipe in his mouth. - I wish - said he, in a tone of feeling impatience - I wish Trim was returned. - At that moment the door opened, and Trim entered. - My uncle Toby started up from his chair - "A Capitulation, Trim?" - An' please your Honour - replied Trim, in a firm tone of voice - You may starve him out sooner.</p> <p>Had my uncle Toby, at the head of a brave</p>

         <p>legion, been totally defeated, he would not have looked more sorrowful: - the pipe drooped between his fingers, and the tobacco fell from it to the ground. - </p> <p>An' please your Honour - said Trim - when I saw him - I couldn't speak to him. - I didn't like his countenance - but I gave him the packet. - He looked at the direction, - then at me - then at the direction again. - "This is from ANNA!" - said he, frowning. - Then it's from as honest a soul - said I - as any in his Majesty's three kingdoms. - He looked as black as gunpowder at me, your Honour, - and then read the letters. - "Serve him right!" - said he - (I suppose, your Honour, he meant his being kidnapped first, and killed afterwards) - "let her starve! - and harkee, fellow! if you trouble me any more about her and her bastards," - </p>
            <pb n="131" xml:id="pb-131" facs="#i149"/>
            <p>Bastards! - said I - they are as honestly begotten as yourself - (I could not help it, your Honour - I liked his countenance little, and his language less.) - And what - said I - if they were bastards? - they could not help it, poor babes! - but if only Bastards had hard hearts, I should believe your Honour as vile a one as any in the kingdom! - I thought, an' please your Honour, he was going to attack me, but I was ready to receive him; - indeed, your Honour, I believe he saw I was a Soldier, for I thought it my duty to defend the defenceless: - poor EDWARD is dead! - he couldn't stand up for himself! - to insult the grave is dastardly, - but to insult the grave of a Soldier - and a son too! - I couldn't bear it. - </p> <p> - Describe his person, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby. - Trim bowed. - Why, then, an' please your Honour, - he has as forbidding</p>

            <p>a countenance as you would see in the face of a Ruffian; - his cheeks worne, - his forehead cloudy and wrinkled; - his body wasted - </p> <p> - It is his conscience that preys upon him, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby. - </p> <p> - An' please your Honour - replied Trim - I do not think he has one; - he looks like one of those soldiers who doesn't fight for the sake of a good cause, your Honour, - but for the plunder he expects afterwards. - His hair is almost white - </p> <p> - His actions are a disgrace to his head, Trim! - said my uncle Toby. - </p> <p>An' please your Honour - quoth Trim - he has no more feeling in his heart than a bullet. - </p> <p> - Then we must be fathers to the fatherless, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby. - I am sorry you returned his fire, Trim! - it</p>

            <p>is noble to be a faithfully ally, - but it is wise to be a peaceable one also. - </p> <p>At this moment a Messenger enter'd the room. - It was from ANNA'S father; - he had burst a blood-vessel in the violence of his passion, which continued after Trim had left him. - He wish'd to see ANNA, and the Corporal. - I called for ANNA - said the Messenger, and she directed me here. - Her father wishes to see her, and the Soldier he offended. - I fear he will not be long in this world! - Advance, Trim - quoth my uncle Toby - and give him all the succour you are able. - An' please your Honour - said Trim - I pity him now! - </p> <p>Trim, though fatigued, remember'd he was going upon duty; - his knee pain'd him, - but the lightness of his conscience made his steps easy! - </p>

            <p>As Trim departed, my uncle Toby and he exchanged something like a congratulatory look. - They had made overtures for peace, but were refused; - the enemy to sue in turn - it was glorious! - But my uncle Toby and Trim loved peace too sincerely to trifle with the feelings of the enemy.</p>

            <p>MY uncle Toby now filed another pipe. - Suspense lengthened the pauses between each whiff, - while FANCY painted to his imagination, Trim entering - the olive branch and the laurel budding on his brow. - </p> <p> - There was something of an April cast in the countenance of my uncle Toby; - for although a sunshine settled on it, - still a few light clouds kept continually passing it: - These were but thin shades of UNCERTAINTY crossing HOPE. - </p> <p>The sun was now going down: - as the day-beam waned, my uncle Toby's impatience increased; - his eyes were ever and anon fixed on the lock of the door. - He rose up - walk'd</p>

Trim - quoth he - in a low tone of monotonous despondency - "Have we lost the day again?" - An' please your Honour - replied Trim - I called for ANNA, as the Messenger directed me. - We took her and her sweet little babes with us; - and when we reached her father's door, the first account we received from an old female housekeeper was - He was dead! - </p>
            <pb n="137" xml:id="pb-137" facs="#i155"/>
            <p> - An' please your Honour, poor ANNA sunk on the threshold. - When we recovered her - she would see her father - she flew to his bed; - the face of her father, an' please your Honour, was the face of a stranger! - she threw her arms round his neck, and wetted his cheeks with her tears. - "You cannot push me from you now!" - said she, clinging to him - and turning back her head, as if she fear'd being taken from him. - An' please your Honour - she kissed his cold lips, as if she were struck with madness. -</p> <p>ANNA will turn melancholy! - quoth my uncle Toby, pressing his hands together. - </p> <p> - Consider, your Honour, - said Trim - she is delicate, and her misfortunes are too heavy for her. - An' please your Honour, his Will was lying by his side; </p>
