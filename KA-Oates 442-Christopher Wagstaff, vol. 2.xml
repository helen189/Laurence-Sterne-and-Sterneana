            <p>Contains the editor's PROLEGOMENA to the second volume.</p>
            <p>I Was almost got to the end of my first volume (which, you know, was my last) before this excellent word, (only mind it, Miss,) Prolegomena, came into my head; and, so pleased was I with the sound of it, (I must be at the expence of another parenthesis to tell you I</p>
            
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i8"/>
            <p>am a perfect adept in Thonics) that, had it not been for the danger of drawing all the gentlemen of the quill upon my back, (whether I mean critics, or clerks to attornies, you may guess for me) I had certainly wrote a chapter upon it at the conclusion of the volume aforesaid. For, Madam, you must known this word, notwithstanding the antiquity and nobleness of its extraction, (it being by descent a Grecian) and the wonderful coalescence of strength and sweetness in its pronunciation, hath not really one single grain more of sense or importance in it than Preface, or Introduction. Now, Madam, you must be sensible, either of these would make but an indifferent appearance at the end of a book. And so I shall make no farther apology for placing my Prolegomena here. -</p>
            <p>But why here, Sir? Your Prolegomena have no more business here, than they had there; your work is but one work, tho' you should continue it thro' twenty</p>

            <p>volumes; and consequently whatever your wisdom, or your necessity might suggest to you to say in its favour, should all have been said previously to the work itself. Sir, a preface any where after the first sheet of volume the first, is, I must tell you, locally ridiculous and absurd.</p>
            <p>Madam, I have precedents -</p>
            <p>I do not know a single one that affects your case.</p>
            <p>Then Madam, I must aver that an extraordinary case supersedes all ordinary rules; and he that can't find a precedent, must make one. - Besides, it is apparent, or will be however upon a little enquiry, that a second volume doth, as such, stand in particular need of an apologetical page or two, or three, or more, according to the exigence of the writer. - To number one we are strongly attached both by nature and education; and yet there is such an unaccountable fatality against number two, or a second anything, which</p>
            
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i10"/>
            <p>is the very next-door neighbour to it, as is not to be equalled in the case of any given number of integers in the whole province of arithmetic. Almost every thing vile, derogatory, and despicable, is affixed to the idea of it. - I would no more purchase a horse that always was known to come in second, than I would one that never saved his distance. - Doth any gentleman of taste or reputation buy a coat in Monmouth-Street, or a wig in Middle-Row? - And why not, but because these pieces of personal furniture are a those places to be had only at second hand? If a man is beaten by his wife, or any other adversary, or happens to fall into a ditch, or to break his shins against a bench, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. he will presently be told by some sneering rascal, that he came off second best. - In short, a second in fighting, a second rate man of war, the Scottish gift of second sight, now and then a second course at dinner, and, in a few instances, second thoughts excepted,</p>
            
            <pb n="7" xml:id="pb-7" facs="#i11"/>
            <p>no number doth import meanness and inferiority, like the unfortunate one or rather two under present consideration. - And the misfortune is, the prejudices and prepossessions against it, I had almost said aversions to it, are remarkably strong in most literary cases. - It is generally taken for granted, the second part of an historical ballad or any performance whatsoever falls infinitely short of the first. - The answer, or, as it may be properly called, the second part to a love-song, is never read with half the delight and complacency which the said song originally gave, or primarily, if you think that word better adapted to this place. - Indeed we have striking examples of the real or reputed inferiority of second parts in the productions of writers of the first magnitude in the learned world.</p>
            <p>Stop, stop - a writer of magnitude! - Let's see - magnifico, - magnifier, - magnify -, O here it is - magnitude -</p>

            <p>O Johnson, Johnson, thou hast made (I hope thou wilt never spoil) many a critic. - And so I proceed to facts. - What do you think of Mr. Pope's Odyssey, which is the second part of his Homer; or the continuation or second part of Mr. Gay's Beggar's Opera, or of the second part of the celebrated John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, or of the Paradise regained of the much more celebrated John Milton? - Do not these things make you sick of second parts? - I have heard of a discourse, or treatise, or essay, or something, written by one Thomas Aquinas, and entitled, Secunda Secundae! - Such an impudent duplicate of seconds is most abominable. Iâll never believe there is a tolerable sentence in the whole book. - And now, gentle reader, in a situation so</p>

            <p>uncomfortable as this, what shall I say by way of recommendation of this second volume? How shall I subdue thy prejudices, or allure thy favourable opinion? Shall I tell thee I have taken more pains in compiling and digesting it, than the other cost me? shall I assure thee this volume was really written first, altho' it be printed last? - No - I scorn such shifts and artifices as these. - I know but one rule of dealing for couples of any kind; i.e. to be contented to take them as they come. - It is a thousand to one, a married couple are not exactly fellows. -</p>
            <p>'Tis strange you can't let men and their wives alone. - This is not the first time. - </p>
            <p>Pray, do not be angry, my dear conjugated Sir; - I meant to reflection upon you. -</p>

And the like may be said of any animal couple in the known world. - Now, Sir, apply these remarks to a couple of books; and when you have read over both these volumes, and will be so kind as to point out to me the several; faults of either, I will endeavour to do something towards your satisfaction hereafter, by amending them all in that only desirable second to a need writer, a second edition.</p>
            <p>CHAP. II.</p>
            <p>Which the editor dedicates, with the remainder of this book, to all silly folk, and those who read novels and romances, both in town and country.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN and LADIES, - of all ages, sizes, complections, and denominations,</p>
            <p>AS singular as this address may seem, I am induced to it by a motive as general as possible; it being a principle</p>

            <p>common to all authors to secure, by the best means they may, a numerous, and powerful party in their favour. - I must confess indeed, I ought, in point of prudence as well as good-manners, to have paid my compliments dedicatory to you long before; but your good-nature will permit me to urge that plea in excuse of my neglect, which is upon all occasions your own standing apology, viz. that I really did not think of it. - You will not however (as it is not yet too late( give me leave humbly to solicit your countenance and protection; which alone can secure from, or rather render me invulnerable by, the attacks of my literary enemies. - For tho' r-g-es and r-sc-ls in high station may be, upon many accounts, serviceable to other members of the community, yet f--ls only are the men, or the women, for us modern authors. No performance of our's can possibly gain its ends but through your kind patronage and encouragement, be they</p>

            <p>what they will, or as many as they may be. - Now a book in general, you know, has indeed four ends; which are more than a fiddle-stick has, by two. The first is, - the reader's instruction; the second, his entertainment; the third, the author's reputation or literary character; the fourth, the benefit or profit of the same. The first of these, if we do not wholly disavow, we very rarely at least accomplish, and that but accidentally as it were and collaterally; the second, we easily enough effect, when we can once get ourselves acquainted wit your tastes and the measure of your apprehensions; the third, we utterly disclaim, having no desire of preserving our names except in the parish register, and conceiving other notions of those worthy gentlemen who shall be, than to suppose a work calculated for your present amusement can have any claim upon their notice; the fourth, we have principally in view, as our summum bonum,</p>
            
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i17"/>
            <p>or our meat, drink, washing, and lodging; for all which articles we must gratefully acknowledge ourselves indebted to your bounty.</p>
            <p>I have the honour and happiness to address myself to persons of all ranks, orders, parties, (if there by any now in being) and persuasions; and may therefore reasonably hope my support and success will be accordingly extensive; especially as you have already seen, and will farther see, that over and above the pretensions of this address, the work I am publishing, and occasionally embellishing, hath an equal title to your regard with the most extraordinary modern performances, in respect of matter, manner, method, design, and argument. - It would become me, in quality of a dedicator, to take this opportunity of loading you, gentlemen, with praise and panegyric; but as you are so large a body that it would be impossible to do ample justice to you all, I must be contented with publicity</p>

            <p>CHAP. III.</p>
            <p>The author's compliments to the reader, wishing him well through this volume.</p>
            <p>NOW does the reader greedily expect a description of London; ay, and such an one it shall be, when it once comes, as shall put out of countenance Stow's Survey, Howel's Londinopolis, Delawn, B. B. and all that have ever written about it since London-stone was no bigger than a cherry-stone, or Julius Caesar (who was an excellent architect) built the what d'ye call it in the tower. Julius Caesar was a Roman; and, as the learned say, the Romans were an honest set of fellows enough, before they turned Catholics. But what is become of the description of London? O, when it comes, it shall be super-admirable; I question not in the least, no not in the least, but 'twill pit, box, and gallery </p>

            <p>with - let me see - with, - ay with Jordan's lord-mayor's show, or his successors either; though that's a bold word, that's the truth of it.</p>
            <p>By this time I guess the reader is as big up to the chin with expectation, as Mrs. Abigail and her little master at Bartholomew Fair, when they are just going to begin for two or three hours together; and, to satisfy his curiosity, I tell him now, whatever I made him believe in the last chapter, that he is not like to hear a word more about London these two hours. Thus do I love to elevate and surprise, and sprinkle now and then some of that same in my writings which is so remarkable in my self - that people should miss what they expected, and find what they never look'd for. - Nor must you think I do this without sound advisement and sage reason: for my father coming here full in my way, and he being nearer akin to me than all the city of London put together; besides, he conveying</p>
            
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i21"/>
            <p>me thither, and placing me there; all the reason in the world I should dispatch him first - that is to say, make an end of him - that is to say, in a civil way, finish and close altogether his life and death, and pay that just tribute of tears, elegies, signs, groans, and acrostics, which are due to his super-precious memory. - Besides to have my father's whole life together, the great father of Christopher Wagstaff, Gent. - why it looks noble and very fine, and will be as proper and pertinent as any thing in the book. - For when the readers of this book, one lord or t'other earl, this wit and that justice of peace, shall find the marvellous deeds of the son, they'll be very willing to go a little higher; they will be extremely well pleas'd to see the wondrous father of this wondrous son all together in one piece, not hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd about, thro' all the twenty-four volumes; here an arm, and there a leg, and there another member.</p>

Is't the first then? it should have been the first, but by mistake 'tis the second. - The father ought to go before the son, because he was born before me. I write nothing but what's chastest truth, and all the neighbours can justify it. Well then, now you have it; you can't miss it if you had ne'er so much mind to it. Vol. ii. chap. iii.

            <p>CHAP. IV. The author's.</p>
            <p>You'll see the contents of it.</p>
            <p>MY father was born - what need you know where? is it not enough I have told you my birth-pace, Graffham, dearest Graffham? hold, hold; I was just going to ramble away to it again, and leave my very father for my country. But, as I was saying, what shou'd people be so inquisitive for? this prying world wou'd fain know my father; thank 'em for that; if they know father they'll know me. So, who he was, gentlemen, must be a secret. Is it not sufficient in conscience that I wear</p>
            
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i24"/>
            <p>so many flowers, feathers, bells, and fine things about me, and turn myself out to the world to let 'em laugh their small guts out, but I must needs shew my face too? not that I'm at all asham'd of it. I'm no panther; I don't say 'tis one of the best that nature ever form'd, but 'tis a 'tis, and there's an end on't; and whose 'tis, do you fish out if you can, for is I tell you, hang me at my own sign post. But what's all this to my father? why truly as near as father and son. And so this father of mine, Sir, as I was saying, was born, bred, and educated, by the joint endeavours of my grand-father and grand-mother, and by the help of three schools, and one university. In his younger days he wrote verses, which he burnt when he came to an age of discretion. After some years spent in study, to what purpose I never heard him say, he settled in the world, as a man of sense and resolution should do. And then he had several children.</p>
            
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i25"/>
            <p>Oh! but I should have told you first, (should not I) that he was married to my mother, which he certainly was, about the year 16 with two more figures to it, my mother fell sick, and dy'd, and was almost buried, as I am very confident I told you before, and then came to life, and dy'd again in good earnest, and was buried accordingly. Upon this my father, (who had something too of the rambler in his constitution, you will see by this, as well as his son, whence you make take notice, I'm no degenerate branch, nor ramble from my virtuous and worthy progenitors, no matter for their names, tho' in good earnest I almost do from my sense; - pray reader put me right again; - whereabouts was I before I slept over the unconscionable Essex stile of this overgrown bursten-gutted parenthesis;) - O - then my father went a rambling, to shew his son the way, and so he travelled by land and by sea 'till he arrived at Ireland; being</p>
            
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i26"/>
            <p>resolved to serve a long seven-years apprenticeship to grief and sorrow, (or rather to do journey work) for the loss of his dearest partner; and by the persuasion of his dearest friends, or his own inclination, no great matter which, (no do I find it decided in his writings) he there studied physick, partly to divert his melancholy, and partly for the benefit of the island, where he performed as many cures as he had patients; the number of which is not yet ascertained. 'Twas pity so useful a stranger, ever came home again; however home again he came, and being assured his wife, his dear wife, and my dear mother, was dead in good earnest, having waited seven long years to see whether she'd come out of her trance the second time, and his lost Euridice would return any more, (for once, you know, she had agreeably deceived him) finding all quiet and silent, her grave overgrown with grass (which could scarce have been the</p>

            <p>After that he had several hopeful sons and daughters, many of whom are still surviving; but the flower of his secondary family was my half-sister, &amp;c. &amp;c. - tace - she will be too proud, if she sees her name here in words at length.</p>
            <p>CHAP. V.</p>
            <p>The author's true account of his father continued.</p>
            <p>I'LL not attempt to number all the great and good actions of such a father as mine was, for a very good reason, namely, because 'tis impossible; for sooner could I tell you how many</p>
            
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i28"/>
            <p>stars there are in heaven, or sands on the sea-shore, or how many virtues Judith has, (I warrant, you thought I had forgot her) or how many of her kisses will satisfy her ravished, transported, stark-staring-mad-with-love Christopher. Nay, perhaps, were this possible to be done, prudence and duty would go together by the ears, and one strive and tug one way, and the other t'other, when I ought to publish these things or not: for perhaps the exuberant glories of his life and actions would eclipse my own, and render me a meer noddy in comparison of him. And truly things being thus, charity begins at home, and I ought to have some regard for my dear self, as well as for my dear father, tho' hardly can I pronounce which is most so. However I can safely aver, he had many a quality of the valuable sort; he was thrifty, and frugal, and careful of his family; gave his sisters portions, and left a good estate and plentiful fortunes</p>
            
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i29"/>
            <p>among his own hopeful children, which in my judgment is commendation enough for one father.</p>
            <p>CHAP. VI.</p>
            <p>The editor seasonably introduces here, a defence of bad writing.</p>
            <p>THE liberty of the press is to be numbered among the choicest privileges of a free people. A question it hath been, and a question it is of great consequence to the public, whether there be more FOOLS or KNAVES in the world? Nothing can so soon, or so effectually determine this point as a general indulgence, in virtue of which every man may publish what he pleases without let or molestation. By this means thousands of his majesty's subjects would appear to have no designs in their heads, who may now be suspected to have bad ones. And therefore, as well</p>
            
            <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i30"/>
            <p>for the ease and comfort of such, as in order to the discovery of so considerable and inoffensive a part of the community, I could wish to see all the REVIEWERS silenced by authority; who are for ever laying stumbling blocks and discouragements in the way of illiterate and honest men. - Let no one misapprehend me. - I mean not to debar these gentlemen of the liberty contended for in behalf of others; or to insinuate that the bulk of modern critics have no claim to the protection of the present chapter. - I am not an enemy to folly, but to the affectation of wisdom; and therefore, when the gentlemen just named, who may now be called fools deponent, will commence fools neuter, or fools common, they shall have my consent to write 'till their fingers ach, and their heads too.</p>
            <p>Upon these principles, and for the aforesaid purpose of discrimination, I am no more for aiding and assisting folly</p>
            
            <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i31"/>
            <p>by unnatural helps, than for obstructing and incommoding it by ill-natured discouragements. For which reason I must protest against the marble covers, gilt backs, pompous frontispieces, and other adscititious embellishments, by which so many fine books in the libraries of the curious are at once ornamented and disguised. It is absurd that any thing lettered should appear about the production of a fool.</p>
            <p>Besides these tricks and contrivances will be absolutely needless, when once matters are adjusted; and it can be effectually ascertained whether ignorance or wisdom ought to be ashamed of itself. I would fain ask the wisest man upon earth, (if the monthly reviewers can tell me which is he) who have made most mischief in the world, your arrant blockheads, or the knowing ones? your wits, and your casuists, forsooth? Are not these latter perpetually running foul of one another, like man and wife</p>
            
            <pb n="28" xml:id="pb-28" facs="#i32"/>
            <p>while the former are as loving as brothers? What but the - (what the reader pleases) of the wise hath stirred the flames of controversy with the poke of disputation, (I speak in their own way) which would have lain formant in the smoke of dulness and ignorance? What hath set states and potentates, princes, prelates, and presbyterian parsons, and as many &amp;cs. as would fill a page, together by the ears, like the learned polemical billingsgate of moralists, critics, philosophers, politicians, and divines? - Odds my heart, if I am once put in a passion, I will engage in a couple of chapters to rail all the learning among us out of the kingdom. - We are told (I think it is by Martial the historian) that seven cities (I forget the names of them) were at daggers drawn about the carcass of Homer; like the Greeks and Trojans over the body of Patroclus. What a comfortable reverse of things do we see at this day, when</p>
            
            <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i33"/>
            <p>seventy-times-seven poets may, I will not say genteelly, but peaceably, be accommodated in one city!</p>
            <p>But not to insist upon the negative advantages resulting from bad writing, and on what it will not, or rather cannot do; I must aver there are many positive circumstances in its favour. Its several domestic uses in the parlous, the garret, the kitchen, and the pantry have been often expatiated upon by others; and whether one book that is a friend to a man in his necessities be not really worth a dozen which are immured in a closet, he cannot possibly know what a pressing exigence is, who is at a loss to determine. A good book is fit for nothing that I know of but to be read; but a bad one will answer an innumerable multitude of purposes, both serious and comical. It may, for instance, be part of a boy's kite, a benighted man's lantern, a sick man's opiate, and any man's pane of a window.</p>
            
            <pb n="30" xml:id="pb-30" facs="#i34"/>
            <p>Was there occasion I could enlarge on these, and other collateral advantages of bad writing over good, which might be mentioned: as this, - that, whereas you will be puzzled to death if you do not proceed regularly and methodically from the very first page to the last in the perusal of a learned folio, quarto, or duodecimo (I do not find any odds), you may read in any place, and from any chapter or period, the productions of the unlearned, with the same pleasure and improvement.</p>
            <p>Or this - that though it be necessary, upon many accounts, to keep your several sets of good books entire, and not unconcatenated, (I scorn to say, if I may so say, when I have so said) (pray, my lord, is the expression offensive to your eye, to your ear, or to your teeth?) you may lose or give away two or three volumes of such a performance as I have been recommending, and the work shall to all intents whatsoever be as complete</p>
            
            <pb n="31" xml:id="pb-31" facs="#i35"/>
            <p>as before. - To be brief - In the name of the dullest of the nine muses, (the muse that presided over Cibber's odes, I don't mean his comedies, I say, I don't mean his comedies) why should dulness be contemptible, when every one knows how much - but mum - He who would be further satisfied in this point should by all means carefully peruse - De Praedicamentis, -'s Poems, -'s Treatise upon -, -'s History of -, and every antient and modern writer who has eminently contributed to make folly illustrious.</p>
            <p>CHAP. VII.</p>
            <p>The author moralizes here like a philosopher: - a tolerable one.</p>
            <p>- HERE being a convenient loophole, I can't forbear a little ramble into the fertile common place of</p>
            
            <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i36"/>
            <p>children's duty and love to their parents, both dead and living, and shall present the reader with several pat, pert, pleasant stories to the purpose.</p>
            <p>How much we are obliged to our parents, can never be enough accounted; that we are so both for our being and education is equally certain. Being is no doubt, in itself considered, without the appendages of any other good, a great happiness, or rather ground of happiness; for we must exist before we can be happy. From our parents, even the worst of men let 'em be, this we at least receive. But more - they bring us into a state wherein every man may have a tolerable degree of happiness, at least generally speaking, if it be not his own fault. <note>Latin</note> Quisquae suae fortuneae faber. Every man is the bricklayer of his own good fortune - (or smith, or carpenter, which you please). If therefore any object, that the being their parents gave 'em makes 'em only miserable, and therefore</p>
            
            <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i37"/>
            <p>they be not obliged to thank 'em for it, they argue very ill, and besides very disingenuously, blaming others for what they brought on themselves; and full as justly may mankind blame him that made them for all the miseries they could not have felt had they not had a being; whereas the major part of them were undoubtedly brought on themselves by their own follies, and vices; and that probably with much trouble, and at a great expence.</p>
            <p>If they'll yet farther object, 'tis n't in a man's choice to be poor or not, for then none would chuse poverty; 'tis easily answer'd, that 'tis perhaps much more so than is generally concluded; most persons by idleness and carelessness reducing themselves to low circumstances, and then falling foul of both on heaven and earth, because they are in distress. - Has thy parent given thee being, and can he do no more? - Why he has done very fairly for thee already - he has made thee</p>
            
            <pb n="34" xml:id="pb-34" facs="#i38"/>
            <p>a freeman of the world, and thou hast a range of many a thousand miles to seek thy fortune in; and how many are there who raise themselves and families on no larger a stock? Nay, what estate was the first man born to, independently of his personal industry and diligence?</p>
            <p>Dost thou say thou art not obliged to thy parents for thy being, because they gave it thee for their own pleasure, or out of a kind of instinct, and almost necessity of nature? - That's a very false, as well as most unmannerly way of arguing; for it indeed destroys the nature of all benefits, and leaves no such thing as obligation in the world. The argument is fairly thus - We are not obliged to any man for any good turn he does us in which he takes pleasure, or, which amounts to the very same thing in the end, which he is under almost a necessity of doing; that indeed is which he cannot without some pain or inconvenience to himself forbear doing. For to</p>
            
            <pb n="35" xml:id="pb-35" facs="#i39"/>
            <p>be fair, the argument can rise no higher. Now lay this rule to any benefit in the world, and see, by Mr. Seneca's leave, what work 'till make with it.</p>
            <p>I do the most virtuous action, the bravest thing in the world, undoubtedly for my own pleasure or happiness, and that is and ought to be the chief end for which I perform it; for why, I'd fain known, do I relieve any man that's miserable, but for the pleasure I myself feel in doing it, or expect from it? Is the man therefore not obliged to me for my kindness? Suppose, by a kind of sympathy, I feel another man's sore leg, thin jaws, or hungry belly, and so even in pity to myself, and to avoid the inconvenience of these sensations, give him a plaister, or a shoulder of mutton; is he therefore under no obligations to me?</p>
            <p>Yet more; will men own they are obliged to their parents for a good education? If not, for what in the world? And yet, what's the giving them this</p>
            
            <pb n="36" xml:id="pb-36" facs="#i40"/>
            <p>but a dictate of nature? - A gratification of a strong propensity, which, whoever is without, is almost as unnatural as the parent who would destroy the being he gave. We do our duty, and we take a pleasure in so doing, when we take care of the education of those whom we brought into the world; and our own credit and comfort are concerned in this: but if our children are not nevertheless to thank us for our trouble, there can be no such thing as a benefit or obligation. In short, a person's being obliged to perform a good turn, or taking a pleasure in doing it, cannot alter the nature of things. - If 'tis fair arguing from contraries, and none ever yet denied it, why then, if the not doing what I'm obliged to deserves disgrace and dispraise, and is an injury, the doing what I ought and am bound to do merits honour, praise and acknowledgement. 'Tis in vain, like the old towring philosophers in days of yore, to sit twisting</p>
            
            <pb n="37" xml:id="pb-37" facs="#i41"/>
            <p>fine notions together, that are too high either for truth or practice; and when brought down, and accommodated to the scene of life, will never square, nor serve any tolerable purpose. The freest thing in the world I may be obliged to by the most indispensable ties, which yet, if perform'd, deserves the clearest and loudest acknowledgement. What is more free, to go back to a former instance, than a generous man's liberality to a worth man in distress? What's he more oblig'd by the laws of our common humanity to do? What can he take more pleasure in? And yet, what can be a greater obligation to the person so assisted.</p>
            <p>CHAP. VIII. The author's, you may swear it.</p>
            <p>- WELL - this 'tis to read Seneca - one notion begets another, and so to the end o'the book,</p>
            
            <pb n="38" xml:id="pb-38" facs="#i42"/>
            <p>while my poor father is forgot all this while as much as if he never begot me. - Did you never hear of Boleslaus - that excellent king of Bohemia, who never enter'd upon any important action, but out he pull'd the picture of his father, and, after gazing on't, as if it had been that of his mistress, used solemnly to desire he might never do any thing unworthy of so great a progenitor? Was he not an ugly rogue of a fellow? And did he not well deserve such a horrid death as got hold of him, who, upon seeing his poor old father coming to his house for a meal's meat, (like a greedy-gut bastard as he was for his pains) claps me up a fat capon, dish and all, under the table, and persuades the old gentleman he had nothing for dinner but rack-staves? - But mark the sequel. On his father's shabbing off again to seek a dinner where he could catch it, or else dine with Duke Humphrey, this rascally son of his pulls out the dish again, and thought</p>
            
            <pb n="39" xml:id="pb-39" facs="#i43"/>
            <p>to be at it immediately up to the knuckles, and fetch up all the time he had lost - When - O! lo! behold a wonder! this fat capon was turn'd, or metamorphos'd into a huge over-grown fat toad - fough upon't! and in half a twinkling shot up like an arrow, and caught this unnatural wretch by the throat, pinching him like a crab 'till he made him yell again; and then crawling up to his mouth and nose, there it sat spitting venom at him 'till he dropt down dead, and never spoke a word more. - I have seen a ballad upon the subject, and an excellent one it was. If I could have procured it, I intended it should have appeared here; but as, you will take my word for it, the thing is true, you need not give yourself the trouble to enquire after it. But mind the moral, and be a dutiful child, if you have a father or mother living; or else get a child, I mean in a lawful way, for yourself, and see how he'll use you. For my own</p>
            
            <pb n="40" xml:id="pb-40" facs="#i44"/>
            <p>part I am so affected with this story, that, notwithstanding some past declarations, I am resolved to spend two or three more chapters upon certain circumstances relating to my own poor father, not so much to shew my wit, as my wonderful and most exemplary gratitude.</p>
            <p>CHAP. IX.</p>
            <p>In which the author, like an honest man, is as good as his word.</p>
            <p>LEST I should have the same ill fortune with the man mentioned a page or two ago (though I confess I did not see him after he was dead) I'm resolved to make much of my father, now he's not only old, but dead, and not only dead, but rotten; although his name still smells sweeter than balsam, even sweet as the breath of my fragrant aromatical Judith.</p>
            
            <pb n="41" xml:id="pb-41" facs="#i45"/>
            <p>Ay, dead he is sure enough, after he had carefully bound me 'prentice, as I told you before, and you shall hear hereafter - he's as dead as Nebuchadnezzar - though his fame shall never die, while either his son, or his son's son shall remain alive. And I will have a son for my father's sake. But when and how did he die? and where? and wherefore? and for what reason - quis? quid? ubi? quibus? &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To the when, I answer, November 4, 1674, an aetat, 48; and that's as much as many an honest man gets for his epitaph - but every honest man is not my father.</p>
            <p>And being dead, 'twill be very conconvenient to give him speedy burial, i.e. as soon as decently and safely may be. One may be too hasty in that matter. Duns Scotus, who had as subtle a head as my father for his life, was yet fool'd out of this world that way, and buried alive, poor wretch! It has been</p>
            
            <pb n="42" xml:id="pb-42" facs="#i46"/>
            <p>many a man's case, I say a coffin has; and a confounded hard case too the philosopher found it notwithstanding his knack at solving difficulties. Don't laugh - 'tis no laughing business. To prevent this small inconvenience, his relations wisely fearing my father might have three lives, because my mother had two, who was so much weaker than him, kept him above ground ten days after his death, to see whether he intended to come back again; but finding him in earnest, and still remaining in the same sullen humour, they then would wait no longer, but e'en heav'd him into his last tenement in the chancel. -</p>
            <p>And there let him lie 'till I come to him - and how sweetly should he and I and Judith lie there together in one another's arms? - Lie further father; you have got all the bed to yourself, and thrust us out upon the bedstead; but though you had possession first, yet two</p>
            
            <pb n="43" xml:id="pb-43" facs="#i47"/>
            <p>to one are odds. - However, I'll be a dutiful son, dead and living; and rather lie upon the boards than hurt your ribs, which by this time may be a little tender. - Mercy on us! - we shall never get to London! I tell you we are within a very few chapters of it, if you will have bit patience. Suppose I have a mind to put off my account of it 'till the tenth volume, can you help yourself? - Sit still then, and I'll use you better than you deserve, it may be.</p>
            <p>CHAP. X.</p>
            <p>Which, by the author's leave, I think should have been the IXth.</p>
            <p>WELL remembered! I should have told you how my father died, before how he was buried. - Sir, he died like an honest and brave man, as he had liv'd; for sure having liv'd so well almost fifty years, he could ne'er</p>
            
            <pb n="44" xml:id="pb-44" facs="#i48"/>
            <p>be to learn to die well for one quarter of an hour. He looked as if he would have put death out of countenance, as if he rather wish'd it than fear'd it - not because he was frowardly weary of this life, but rationally assured of a better. He was not like that fool of a philosopher, who, after some three or four-score years huffing God and man, and pretending to teach them both more than they knew before, had not learned wit enough all that while to know whither he was going, and could leave no wiser saying behind him than that of the poor heathen - <note>Latin</note> Quae nunc abibis in loca? - He had found a hole to creep out of the world at, and was going to take a long leap in the dark, he could not tell whither. -</p>
            <p>Next, where did he die? - why at - a certain place in England, that you shall not know 'till you find his epitaph; nor perhaps then.</p>
            
            <pb n="45" xml:id="pb-45" facs="#i49"/>
            <p>Last of all, quare, wherefore, or for what reason? Why that's a very Irish question seemingly now, though it is asked in Latin. I scorn to put the world off with that vulgar answer, as trite as Ratcliff-highway, for want of breath, or because he could live no longer; because every magpye dies at that rate, and for such sage reasons: - But my father's death, as well as his life, was very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>The cause then of the fatal dissolution of that beloved life, more precious than both the Indies, was no other than the incurable putrefaction of some morbid juices in the renal concavities. - To speak plain (for I write for every body, though I protest it's much harder to stoop my notions to people's capacities, than at first to invent them) he died of the stone in the kidneys or bladder, (I can't be positive) after the most exquisite torments, equall'd by nothing but his patience. - There's a father if you</p>
            
            <pb n="46" xml:id="pb-46" facs="#i50"/>
            <p>talk of a father - I must, I may, I shall, I will be as proud of him as Alexander was of Jove.</p>
            <p>Not Great ALCIDES, fam'd TYRINTHIAN hero,<lb/>
            Who slew the fifty-headed HYDRA fell,<lb/>
            And dread NEMAEAN quadruped; -</p>
            <p>Not he, nor e'er a heroic kilcow of 'em all ever kick'd up with half a quarter of that constancy and gravity with which Kit Wagstaff's father did - who was rackt and tormented worse with that milstone of a stone he carry'd about him than Hercules was with his poison'd jerkin.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XI.</p>
            <p>A chapter of wonders; or the author's reports.</p>
            <p>I Have heard of a person yet living, who had a stone in his kidneys of such a prodigious magnitude, that it fill'd</p>
            
            <pb n="47" xml:id="pb-47" facs="#i51"/>
            <p>up almost all the concavity of his carcase; and you might easily feel it thro' his flesh if you laid your hand on his back. I can't say what truth there is in't; nor wou'd the world any sooner believe me should I assure 'em that the stone in my father's body was so immense, that I've often wonder'd if did not bunch up behind, and give him a hump-back; or at least overpoise him in walking and drag him backward with its incredible weight.</p>
            
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i52"/>
            <p>CHAP. XII.</p>
            <p>The editor takes this opportunity to insert a chapter of material intelligence.</p>
            <p>On the 1st of June will be published,</p>
            <p>(To be continued monthly, in small pocket volumes, 'till the whole is completed)</p>

            <p>A New Work, entitled,</p>
            <p>THE BRITISH MERCHANT; or Commercial Biographer. Being a select collection of the lives at large of the most eminent merchants, traders, dealers, and chapmen, from the conquest to the reign of GEORGE II. inclusive, in the cities of LONDON and BRISTOL, and the town of LIVERPOOL. The whole faithfully extracted from authentic account-books, and written intelligence; and abounding with an infinite variety of anecdotes and</p>

            <p>entertaining secrets relative to the mystery of trade, in all its branches, both by sea and land; and containing much superfluous knowledge, and many genuine narratives of several persons and facts, hitherto unknown to, or unnoticed by the public. Adorned with copper-plates neatly engraved. With vol.i. will be given three curious heads, viz. those of the celebrated London 'Prentice, and the famous Whittington and his Cat. - The whole bring intended as a supplement to the BR-T-SH PL-T-RCH.</p>
            <p>N.B. It is computed, this world will be comprised in about two hundred and fifty volumes at most; but if there be any overplus, they shall be given gratis to the purchasers or the former volumes.</p>

            <p>and are in reality in themselves so fallacious, that the authors of the BRITISH MERCHANT beg leave' to hope their candid readers will suspend their judgments of this work 'till the whole is finished; when we doubt not, they will be so perfectly satisfied of the nature of our design, and our industry in prosecuting it, as never to be purchasers of any other work of this kind.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XIII.</p>
            <p>The author continues to be very nonsensical, or very satyrical, as before.</p>
            <p>HOwever he died; dead he is and buried - but not without his taking a decent civil leave of the world - he was not in so great haste to be so unmannerly, or rub off without telling any body.</p>
            <p>Some of his last advice to us his beloved off-spring was, that we should</p>
            
            <pb n="51" xml:id="pb-51" facs="#i55"/>
            <p>live in peace, and love one another; which those of my brethren who don't, who love others better than they love me their brother, ay, and their elder brother, their hope, and prop of their family, their Christopher - I say no more, but let them look to it, and get off as well as they are able. - And may Kit. Wagstaff get over that troublesome ditch that parts this world and the other as well as his father did, when it comes to his turn to leap!</p>
            <p>Those shapes of torture which to view in paint<lb/>
               Would make another faint,<lb/>
               He did endure in true reality,<lb/>
               And feel what they could hardly bear to see.<lb/>
               - His soul as freely from his body went,<lb/>
               As if both parted by consent:<lb/>
               No murmur, no complaining, no delay -<lb/>
               Only a sigh! - Ah John! Ah Nan! and so away.<lb/></p>
            <p>Well - I protest a man's genius improves with using it; - the reader may well wonder at some great master strokes</p>
            
            <pb n="52" xml:id="pb-52" facs="#i56"/>
            <p>in poetry among my works, and many of them so strangely like what he has seen in other places; - for good wits will jump - and yet others so very unlike - for I scorn always to thieve; and indeed hop no man will own any of his goods upon my ground - but this wonder will be a little moderated, when I tell him a secret (that last sentence was a long one; I hope all was right.) 'Tis that I and certain near and dear friends of mine used a long time to write epistles in verse to one another, which so strangely improv'd my hand at it, that were that learned and reverend author Mr. John Bunyan yet living, I would not fear to enter the lifts with him in poetry, rhyme for rhyme, rapture for rapture, my pen and ink to his budget; and let him drop distichs as long as he would, as the blind beggar and the knight did their gold, I wou'd not fear keeping pace with him. 'Twas this, I say, which brought me to be as you see,</p>
            
            <pb n="53" xml:id="pb-53" facs="#i57"/>
            <p>gentlemen. - I vow there's no cheat in me - be you but judges now - take the last verse.</p>
            <p>- Ah John! Ah Nan! and so away. - How soft, how natural and easy - is it not fine - is it to be match'd again? O envy, envy! thou dumb beast thou! If thou wilt not speak, hold thy tongue! while I explain to such as better deserve it, the meaning of that verse whereof thy ears are not worthy. Ah John! Ah Nan! - You must know my name - Hold, hold, - I cry you mercy, Mr. Reader, 'twas out before I was aware of it - You must know my father had a friend whose name was John, and he had a sister whose name was Nan (Nan by corruption, Ann by baptism). So these two he called upon the very last words he said in this world - and then he died for good and all - and I won't disturb him more, and could almost resolve not to tell you a word more about him - but, 'tis hard for friends to part. - Why</p>

            <p>spare me a page or two more, you'll be never the poorer yourselves at the year's end. - Do be obliging, complaisant, and civil, as I'll be to you when you write a book, and don't give me the lye, or call me flatterer, when I assure you that my father was - you have heard what already - and that I dream'd of his death three days before I heard of it; - though I am confident there have been falser things chronicled than either of these. - But I must just give you my father's epitaph, or I fancy he'll ne'er rest in peace (you'll never see his tomb) by which his character will appear to have been made up of whatever is good in other men; as the painter's Venus was from all the fine women in the country.</p>
            <p>Here lieth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He was capable of every thing, and proud of nothing; nay rather actually master of all things, of all the perfections which could be found or named:</p>

            <p>= He had a tongue fit to converse with angels, and a heart yet better than that tongue; for 'twas so full of virtue and goodness, that it was never to be exhausted. By an unparalleled reach of understanding, he soared above the highest, all other perfections being so far from matching his, that they deserve not to be mentioned; the great distance between them made them appear like a little molehill by the side of a mountain, scarce to be seen, and less to be regarded. In a place of Athens when one named Plutarch, the echo answered philosophy (if he that tells the story don't lye); so, should his name be mentioned there, 'twou'd certainly answer either virtue or Thomas, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Here, as well as any where, may be introduced the editor's following advertisement</p>
            <p>TO THE PUBLIC.</p>
            <p>WHereas many gentlemen, ladies and others, have frequent occasion for ready-made letters, upon all sorts of subjects; poems, odes, and ballads, &amp;c. of all sizes and kinds, but mostly in the love way; good characters for news-papers; epitaphs, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; - this is to give notice, that there is now set up in - street, near - square, an office, which is to be called by the name of,</p>
            <p>The PUBLIC OCCASIONAL COMPOSITION OFFICE;</p>
            <p>where all persons may be accommodated with all manuscript literary articles,</p>
            
            <pb n="57" xml:id="pb-57" facs="#i61"/>
            <p>at a quarter of an hour's notice, and upon reasonable terms:</p>
            <p>By an able MASTER of WRITING with proper ASSISTANCE from both UNIVERSITIES.</p>
            <p>We think it needless to expatiate upon the great utility of an establishment, of which the use and advantage cannot but sufficiently appear to every one who considers the many difficulties of true writing, and the inconveniences which numbers of ladies and gentlemen, either for want of leisure or capacity, are every day put to, to express their thoughts with delicacy, propriety, and consistence, and in words accurately spelt, as well as judiciously chosen. We shall only say, that we despair not of giving satisfaction to all who shall apply for our assistance; and to convince the world that we have their benefit in view rather than our own emolument, in the present important</p>
            
            <pb n="58" xml:id="pb-58" facs="#i62"/>

            <p>CHAP. XV.</p>
            <p>The author's account of London, with other curious particulars.</p>
            <p>I Promise the reader to play at bob-cherry with him no more; but being arrived now at London in good earnest, will give him such a description of that</p>
            
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i65"/>
            <p>famous city as, I'll be bold to say, the world can't parallel.</p>
            <p>- And yet my mind misgives me a little - This is a business of much consequence, which I am going to dive over head and ears into. Some preparatory step ought to be taken. I wish I knew which is the city-muse of all those nine gentlewomen, who are so civil as to help a lame dog of an author over a stile, if he has face enough to ask for assistance. I would certainly invoke her in manner and form extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Immortal CLOACINA, sweetest pow'r -</p>
            <p>Hang it, I am not sure that is her name, so I'll e'en budge on in plain, honest prose without her. So, Reader, do not be too severe upon me; you see I must stand upon my own bottom at last. Consider I am neither philosopher, painter, poet, (certain occasions excepted, you know,) chief-justice, common-council-man, astrologer, or bishop, but a poor, raw, London apprentice. - Let</p>
            
            <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i66"/>
            <p>me be bound though, now I think on't; for mine being, you must understand, a kind of a rambling trade, I shall be able to give a better account of matters after I am settled a little in my occupation.</p>
            <p>To dispatch this then as hastily as possible <note>Black Type</note>- This Indenture witnesseth - That I Christopher Wagstaff, of the town of - in the country of - &amp;c. But not to trouble you will all on't; I was bound to that honest man my master, as well as he to me, before the chamberlain of London, (and a good comely looking gentleman he was, I can tell you,) for seven years, the instrument bearing date from December 7, 1674. - Now you expect my master's name, sign, trade, and all that - no thank you - I ha'n't forgot my indentures - wherein I swore i keep his secrets - and this being both his and my own, if you'd rip up my guts for't, you should not have it.</p>
            <p>And what good would it do you if you had it? The description of London</p>
            
            <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i67"/>
            <p>will be ten times more to the purpose, which I'll promise you, as being the best flower in the book, shall be my masterpiece - And therefore I'll begin with the name of it methodically.</p>
            <p>Whence now should that be derived but from King Lud, the founder, the son or father, 'tis no great matter which, of the famous King Bladud, that flew I know not how many miles an hour, and set the devil a boiling his coppers at Bath, I don't know how many thousand years ago. - What would people have more - can there be a clearer argument that this is true, than the very gate's being called Ludgate to this day, after his name? - One can scarce tell what this infidel world will believe - Why there's a great many score of freemen prisoners in Ludgate (some of my acquaintance to my sorrow) who will take their corporal oaths to the truth of all this, as freely as they would, that they ben't worth five farthings a piece, if that would get 'em out again.</p>
            
            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i68"/>
            <p>But for more weighty arguments - what an unanswerable one is there near this gate, besides the gate itself! Is not there a sign with the three kings upon't, one of  which was the founder both of the gate and city adjoining - Androgeus, LUD, and Temautius, or some such name? - I can't imagine what can be plainer. How many millions of men have been contented with this etymology before ever we were born? 'Tis therefore in vain to trouble you with a rabble of other derivations, or make you writhe your mouth five hundred ways with a company of cramp Welsh words, from which some will have London derived. - You may therefore let alone both Lhong Dinan, which signifies Shipton, or a town, famous for the multitude of its ships and navigation - and Lthwindian from Lthwin, signifying fortified woods, in which the ancient Britons built their towns, or which rather indeed were their very towns, before the Romans beat 'em into more</p>
            
            <pb n="65" xml:id="pb-65" facs="#i69"/>
            <p>wit: I say, you may let alone both these cramp words, and their pedigrees or derivations, as Lthwin from wood, and dian, which is the tail of the word, from Diana; (so let her look to it) and be content with what I have made out to you already much better than these Welsh crucifiers of language can do with their hard names, and proud consonants that wont suffer a quiet vowel to keep them company.</p>
            <p>Let this be how 'till, if what I have said cannot be believed, neither will this squeamish world, so much wiser grown all o'th' sudden than their great grandfathers, have any faith in t'other name of this famous city, more antient than this; and yet Julius Caesar, who built the tower of London, and put the lions in't, as sure as ever King Lud built Ludgate, calls it Troynovant - or something so like it, that 'tis only altering five or six letters, and 'twill be the self-same word. - Now those who ha'n't a mind to be</p>
            
            <pb n="66" xml:id="pb-66" facs="#i70"/>
            <p>thought high-born, and nobly-descended, may even laugh at this name as well as the other; but all true Trojans must needs be proud of such honourable and worthy forefathers - who were such indeatigable rambles - first from Troy to Greece - then to Italy, then hither and thither, and nobody knows where, 'till they landed at Totness, and afterwards built Troynovant, or New Troy - as I told you before. And if all this ben't enough, read old Jeffery over, and see if he can satisfy you any better.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XVI.</p>
            <p>The author makes a transition from names to things.</p>
            <p>LET'S begin at Cornhill, and the Royal Exchange - see how things alter - New Troy is just the reverse of the Old, and instead of -<note>Latin</note> nunc seges est ubi Troji, fuit - corn grows where Troy town stood.</p>
            
            <pb n="67" xml:id="pb-67" facs="#i71"/>
            <p>- 'tis now quite the contrary, Troy stands where corn did grow - or at least was brought to market - where no commodities a little more precious are traffick'd for.</p>
            <p>But when I first came under the Exchange gate - bless my ears what a buz there was - 'twas high-change, and such a nation of folk, that I concluded it must needs be either a church or a fair. - And as they humm'd like bees, so they swarm'd like 'em - in and out, and out and in again, backward and forward like the tide at London bridge. - Now while poor Christopher stood harmlessly staring upon some trinkets they had there to sell, comes the eddy of a crowd, and runs him into that whirlpool of man before he knew where he was. - But what a picture of this world did I find there, or rather of that below it!</p>
            <p>- Here was a fat Jew strutting, and a lean christian cringing; a thin old</p>
            
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i72"/>
            <p>usurer bobbing, and a jolly your heir nibbling, and just fit for sealing. A surly sea captain swearing as loudly as he ever did at sea in a storm. One merchant who had received the news of a wreck, biting his nails, and the innocent paper; another, who had heard of the safe arrival of his ship, pluming and cocking, and exhalting himself higher than the 'Change steeple. - Well thought on - we'll step up that way.</p>
            <p>Nay - if this be not paradise, why then a London 'prentice will never find it in this town while he lives.</p>
            <p>'Tis a meer Spring-garden within doors - a Moorfield's walk - a Sir George Whitmore's - a music-house - an every thing. Here's streets, and signs, and paint, and rogues, and jilts, and dogs, and fops, and fools, and women; - lads ogling, lasses winking, maids flickering, wives plotting, musty bachelors moulding,</p>
            
            <pb n="69" xml:id="pb-69" facs="#i73"/>
            <p>and over-grown thornbacks despairing, and just ready to hang themselves in some of their own inkle.</p>
            <p>Do you see that sign there? - The - who would think that modest creature which makes up her mouth like a button-hole, was no longer ago than last night with 'squire -, at the - a-a-ay; what business had she there? - that's the question - Business? why such business as others would have been glad of as well as she - Eating of oysters, and what hurt's in that? - Your servant, ladies. - I am got now into Lombard street.</p>
            <p>Mercy on us! what cart loads of money were there tumbled over one another? - I cou'd not have thought Plutus himself had been so rich - but the truth is, he employs a great many FACTORS - I wandered from one end of the street to the other, and, in a little shop among all the rest, saw one which look'd like an honest man. - There was not a single</p>
            
            <pb n="70" xml:id="pb-70" facs="#i74"/>
            <p>soul in his shop besides himself, who was exercising his patient elbows against the obdurate counter.</p>
            <p>This was many years since, and the city increasing every day, if there was one honest man there then, how many must there be by this time?</p>
            <p>Methinks the very sight of such wealth revives me, and I begin to fancy the gingling of so much money would as soon make one rich, as the smell of roast beef would fill one's belly.</p>
            <p>- Yet avaunt, thou foul fiend! I will not be contaminated! O Mammon! I defy thee - Dost sneer? doest laugh? - dost glow at me? - Nay - 'tis all one - I'll keep out of thy clutches if possible - I'll ramble far enough off from thy ravenous maw. I'll ramble, I say once more, to Amsterdam, Leghorn, China, Tartary, through air, earth, purgatory, and the world in the moon, before I'll have any thing to do with thee, unless in a civil way - in a - way of trade</p>
            
            <pb n="71" xml:id="pb-71" facs="#i75"/>
            <p>as one dealer with another, honestly and fairly, and so forth.</p>
            <p>O Gold! O Gold! - Let me see, - what rhimes to gold - why the lions in the Tower come next - 'tis no matter for rhyme - now for sympathy and antipathy.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XVII.</p>
            <p>With which the editor presents his compliments to the reader.</p>
            <p>THERE is something so truly Shandean in the phaenomenon over the leaf, that I hope, Sir, you will bestow a proper degree of attention upon it.</p>

            <p>- So - you have examined it well. Please to tell me then, Whether you take it to be a mathematical figure, the plan of a grid-iron, or the skeleton of a multiplication table?</p> 
            <p>CHAP. XVIII.</p> 
            <p>Contains the author's account of the lions, and other odd things in the tower.</p> 
            <p>YOUR lion is a strange animal; sometimes as fierce as - I can't think of a simile; - and sometimes as meek as a mouse. A woman with child (I scorn to say by whom) was one of the party, when I went to pay my respects to the four-footed monarch, and his royal family in the tower. When, wonderful to tell, and, by a natural consequence, to be believed, they all to a single beast began roaring louder than the guns on a coronation-day; the very foundations of the gate trembled, the artillery carriages rolled</p> 
            
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i78"/>
            <p>back some years, the portcullis dropt down for fear, and the water in the Thames spouted as high as the monument. In the interim accidentally steps into the place a true maid, a beauteous virgin; when lo! down laid these angry creatures as calmly as lambs; they grin'd, they fawn'd, they wagged their tails; not with such a tremendous sweep as before, but as mildly and gently as the poetical Zephyrs stroke the velvet leaves; their late erected manes lay as flat as a dog's; and they purred as innocently as young kittens. - The keeper declared he had not seen them so tame for a long time. -</p>
            <p>Who to look upon 'em now would think these creatures had torn out the hearts and guts of so many flocks of harmless lambs, or gentle fawns? - Who would think they e'er had roar'd in Mauritanian deserts,</p>
            <p>Where swift Numidians, on the sun-burnt shore,<lb/>
            With show'rs of darts and jav'lins urg'd their fate;</p>
            
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i79"/>
            <p>While with a generous rage, the kingly captives<lb/>
               Leap o'er the toils, and scatter woman, man,<lb/>
               And sucking child, horse, ass, dog, cat, and king;<lb/>
               For All's one that comes near 'em. -<lb/></p>
            <p>There's a rise and a fall - there's two as natural transitions or rambles from low to high, and high to low, - (I am above being compared with any one but myself) as you'll find again in all my works.</p>
            <p>But now I'll tell you a strange story, and a true one, as ever Pliny, or what's his name - told in their lives; gentlemen of such strict honour and irreproachable veracity, that they would no more impose upon the world than Monsieur le Blank, or Sir John Mandevil. - 'Tis concerning the strange nature, gratitude, and generosity of these lions. - N.B. This is a very serious story; it hath something of the nature of a fable in it; and if any of my readers have heard it already, all I can say is, they are more knowing than I could have imagined. However, no</p>
            
            <pb n="76" xml:id="pb-76" facs="#i80"/>
            <p>great harm will be done; for it is not above a leaf or two to the next chapter. - Farther, courteous reader, if thou art alone, I would advise you to read this story inwardly, and to thyself, for the benefit of thy lungs, and to prevent false emphasis and bad pronunciation. If thou art in company, and desired to read out, e'en read it as well as thou canst. -</p>
            <p>"A certain soldier met one day, much against his will, a worshipful old lion, in the middle of an unfrequented wood. Androcles (I think that was his name) was in such bodily fear, that, had he been a Christian, I suppose, he would have said his prayers; had be been a Papist, he would have told his beads; but, as he was but an arrant heathen, it is no great matter what he did. However, to his great surprise, (it is in no history said, to his sorrow) the royal beast meekly approached him with the air and look of a petitioner; and held out one of his paws to him,</p>
            
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i81"/>
            <p>not barely in amity, but by way of application for relief. Our soldier, (who before had rather have faced ten enemies in the field than one lion in a forest) taking heart hereupon, soon perceived a large thorn in the foot of his most obedient humble servant the lion, and with some difficulty extracted it, to the inexpressible comfort of his dumb patient; who, as he had solicited assistance in forma pauperis, retired into this thicket after having paid some antick compliments of thanks to his doctor.</p>
            <p>Some time after, Androcles had the ill fortune to be taken prisoner in battle by the Romans, and was mercifully condemned by those brave people to fight with a lion in the Circus Maximus; a place not much unlike the Bear-garden in London. (All civilized countries have these places of diversion.) Accordingly, he stood armed upon a kind of stage, expecting the hungry foe. The</p>
            
            <pb n="78" xml:id="pb-78" facs="#i82"/>
            <p>den was thrown open; the foe appeared, rolling his fiery eyes, grinding his famish'd jaws, and lashing his hollow sides. But upon sight of his antagonist, he gave signs of the utmost complacency and satisfaction; he gambol'd about him with transport; he licked his hand; and (to close the laborious description) at last he lay down at his feet with the gentleness and familiarity of a spaniel dog that has had something more than bones for his dinner. It seems this lion was the very identical one which the soldier had relieved in the forest; and it is the opinion of all historians and naturalists whatever (as much as they love to differ from one another) that this action amounts upon the whole to a tolerable proof of the gratitude and generosity of the beast, or beasts, we have been discoursing of."</p>
            <p>There's an old story well told; the moral of it is torn out, but may be guessed</p>
            
            <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i83"/>
            <p>at by any person of a moderate capacity; and I hope none but such will buy this book. - But suppose we take a little refreshment here; as there is no extraordinary connection between this chapter and the next, it will be no great inconvenience to us.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XIX.</p>
            <p>A farther account of what the author saw in the tower; with many observations, and most of them pretty much to the purpose.</p>
            <p>AFTER I had taken leave of the lions, I went incontinently to the armory, where I saw arms enough to frighten all the citizens in London - the gentlemen of the train bands excepted! Here I saw weapons, offensive and defensive, enough for half a dozen campaigns. Here too, or not far off, I saw the glories of England, the royal crown and scepter - why (by the by) had like</p>
            
            <pb n="80" xml:id="pb-80" facs="#i84"/>
            <p>to have taken ramble as well as I, and to have been exiled after their owner was come home - that cunning rogue Blood having enticed 'em to run away with him. - I don't care if I tell you the story, because 'tis a pretty one, and because I have a knack at a story, you know. - I can't tell well how it happened, but happen it did, that these two mighty monarchs, colonel Blood the first and king Charles the second, fell out, and declared open war against one another; the colonel having been out-law'd, and so being no longer under the king's protection. He, finding his forces were scarce so many or so strong as his adversary's, betakes himself to stratagem, and disguises himself (a sly toad) in a gown and cassock of all the things in the world; and, having laid horses at convenient places, slips into the tower, and binding and gagging the poor old man, away whips he up the top of three kingdoms in a satchel under his upper habiliment.</p>
            
            <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i85"/>
            <p>So off he marches with his prize: - But the angel that guards the English monarchy sent home the old man's son just in the nick, who finding his father in such a peaceable posture quickly released him, and out came all the truth. - 'Twas not long, you may believe, before a fearful hubbub was set up for the lost perquisites. - Blood had passed one gate before, at the second the cry reached him, and the wardens oppose his passage. - He had not much to say for himself, but up when his brawny paw - fowse down goes one on one side, and the other on t'other, and away marches he between, cuffing his way though 'em all like a Hercules; and out he gets as far as the wharf, when a grim porterly cowardly rogue sneaks behind him, and hits him one unlucky remembrance under the ear; so down went crown, scepter, gown, and colonel altogether, as flat as a flounder; up they took him again, and carried him before the king. - But I happening that day not to</p>
            
            <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i86"/>
            <p>be of the council can't so well tell you what discourse these two great persons had together, nor what articles were drawn between 'em - only Blood came off - a treaty was made, and he lived many a fair year after.</p>
            <p>I observed little else in the tower worth noting, except a kind of an engine like a scholar's horse; a wooden sort of a steed, quite the reverse of master Sinon's; for as that carried soldiers in his belly, this does on its back. But what's that to honest Christopher? It shall be a fair warning to him however; for if he e'er turn soldier, if such be the preferment those poor creatures must meet with, he'll be content to be mounted there, with a whole file of musquets at his heels, 'till king James comes home again.</p>
            <p>But lest he shou'd be pressed for a soldier, and made valourous against his will, he's resolved to stay in that dangerous place no longer. - Away then trudged Christopher; and, because he wou'd be</p>
            
            <pb n="83" xml:id="pb-83" facs="#i87"/>
            <p>sure to be far enough out of mischief, runs up and down two or three streets before he could recover his fright, and then made the best of his way for the famous monument of popish r-g-ry at the bottom of Fish-street hill; (don't you remember the story of the fire of London?) but thro' such crowds of coaches, carts, porters, draymen, oyster-wenches, and ballad-singers, &amp;c. that he cou'd make no reflections upon what he saw for the noise, bustle, and uproar of what he heard.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XX. The editor takes a hint from the last line of the last chapter.</p>
            <p>A chapter of the editor's, in which the reader will find considerable more wit and satire than he could possibly, from the nature of the subject, expect.</p>
            <p>HAVING a call the other day into the farther part of the city, I set out from my lodgings in Spring-gardens</p>
            
            <pb n="84" xml:id="pb-84" facs="#i88"/>
            <p>with a whimsical resolution to charge my memory (an extraordinary good one) with every thing I should overhear in my passage through the streets thither. Sure, I thought with myself, among the great variety of people I shall meet, or overtake, &amp;c. I may pick up scraps and ends of conversation enough to make a very humourous and entertaining miscellany. And to encourage the reader to make the same experiment, I shall here faithfully and regularly communicate to him, to the best of my recollection, every thing I was an ear-witness to, in the course of my walk, upon this occasion.</p>

               - I don't believe he has seen the inside of a church these seven years. -<lb/>
               - Sir, he must be mined; he lost above five hundred pounds last week. -<lb/>
               - The last dying speech and confession of the malefactors executed at Tyburn. -<lb/>

            <p>CHAP. XXI.</p>
            <p>In which the author treats you with an elaborate discourse upon suicide, from the top of the Monument.</p>
            <p>THIS post, pillar, I mean, (saving its reverence) is a very pretty knick-knack; 'tis pity it does not stand in the center of the city, like the middle pin in a bowling alley; - but it is well enough as it is. Now how easily could I from hence, with the feet of my fancy, step over to all the spires in London? But, because I would not break in upon my future design, having resolved to discourse distinctly of my aerial rambles, I'll e'en quietly descend; not by the outside, though that's the shortest cut, as the seaman did who broke his neck from it while it was building, but a little the farthest way about, down the stairs. - Yet hold! is not the outside</p>
            
            <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i94"/>
            <p>road the nearest to my long home, which before I come regularly to, i have many tedious rambles to take - may a sour draught of dolor, and bitter morsel of grief to swallow? truly it were worth while to consider whether I had not better made an end of myself all at once, from this present altitude.</p>
            <p>If a man has not power over his own life, over what has he any? - Nay, 'tis plain, and allowed by all, that he gives that power away (which he could never do, if he never had it,) when he enters into civil society, and submits himself to the laws of government. - Suppose then he has a mind to resume this gift, as not liking the conditions of the civil society, is not his life in his own power again? and is he not at liberty to throw that away, which is much better lost than kept? May not a man cut off a leg or an arm, if he is tired of it? - My body is no better than the legs and arms, or rather crutches of my soul -</p>
            
            <pb n="91" xml:id="pb-91" facs="#i95"/>
            <p>why should it be a crime to throw those crutches away, and go alone, especially when they are troublesome or rotten? Don't all the thinking world agree, that this state we are now in is but a slavery to sense, and a bondage to dull matter, in which we are not only exposed to want and misery into the bargain, but to insults, injuries, and abuses of about five hundred different names and natures? Why then should I not pull up the stake; or get my lock and chain off, and scamper away into the interminable fields of the invisible world? - Happy region of spirits, reason, ease, and rest! - Cleombrotus, Empedocles - O how I envy you! - who rushed, one through the fire, the other through the water, to reach immortality on the other side.</p>
            <p>I have often wondered what makes us fools so childishly fond of life - Life did I call it? - this dream, I mean rather this twilight, battish kind of being</p>

            <p>we rather are comdemn'd to, then properly may be said to enjoy. It is true, honest Kit Wagstaff is happy enough as men, and money, and times go - He has a lovely Judith in his bosom, in his arms, in his heart - ('tis natural for a young lover to reflect first upon these things; and we are neither of us old yet; nor one of us like to be, if I continue in the present humour.) If he has not a lubberly fortune, an over-grown estate, and a hundred and fifty (be they more or less) fancied conveniencies of life, which numbers desire, and none want; if he has not a large palace, a great coach; nay, not so much as a calash or chair to raise the dust before him; yet he has much content without them; and enjoys what he has, without troubling himself about what he has not. He has a good healthy constitution; he's neither racked with stone, gout, nor a worse disease; - he's seldom discontented, or uneasy - he envies no</p>

            <p>Upon the whole he knows not any person in the world with whom he would exchange circumstances. - What a murrain would the man have then? -</p>
            <p>E'en undisturb'd, and everlasting ease. -</p>
            <p>There's a soft line now, which aptly expresses what he wants. - For, notwithstanding all this, he has so vile an opinion of this world, and all its appurtenances, that he most heartily wishes himself in another - Nay he is resolved - Step to the next chapter, and you will see the end of this resolution.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXII.</p>
            <p>The very same discourse is farther prosecuted by the author, and brought to a conclusion.</p>
            <p>'WARE heads below there! - I am this moment going to take a flying leap from the monument into the other world, into a place of eternal ease and blessed repose. - But art though sure of this, Mr. Wagstaff? - If not, methinks it will scarce be worth the while to take this long jump in the dark. Perhaps thy warm imagination has thrown in matter faster than reason could weigh it. - Before thou doest leap, remember it is easier to break a neck than to set it again. - Leave this world thou canst, but thou canst not return to it. - Thy life may be forfeited to law, as thou wert born under civil government, but it follows not therefrom that thou mayst</p>
            
            <pb n="95" xml:id="pb-95" facs="#i99"/>
            <p>throw it away thyself. Thy renouncing the ties of society, or living in a desert, gives thee no right over that being which thou holdest not by human, but divine tenure. He who gave thee life gave it thee in trust, and how canst thou consider it as thine own property? If life be thy property, thou canst make thyself immortal here: - Canst thou do that? - No. - How darest thou then venture into another world without a commission! Suppose inquiry should be made, Who sent for you? I am mistaken if thou wouldst not be put to a non plus. - He who quits his post when ordered upon pain of death to maintain it, tho' it be for what he thinks a more advantageous situation, will hardly come off well with his General. A life well spent, not squandered away, is thy title to a happy immortality. - Thou didst talk about legs and arms, and that too but idly. Remember, if thou cuttest off a leg or an arm, thou doest this with a view to the</p>
            
            <pb n="96" xml:id="pb-96" facs="#i100"/>
            <p>preservation, not the destruction of the remainder of the body. - Besides all this, the going out of the world without a proper summons is, at the vesy best, to change a certainty for an uncertainty; and who but a fool would make such a blind bargain as that? Poverty, sickness, pain, and every earthly grievance thou knowest the worst of; but thou knowest not what evils may be reserved for discontented and ungrateful men in those regions thou, with more curiosity than prudence or piety, wouldst visit. - Furthermore, thy own account of thy worldly situation is comfortable enough: Thou art as happy as a state of imperfection will permit thee to be; and if not even the miserable, much less should others complain that they are not completely happy, in what manner and form, and just when they please. - Very true all this, friend Kit; thou never didst reason better in thy life, albeit thou hast talked in some sort like a Quaker!</p>
            
            <pb n="97" xml:id="pb-97" facs="#i101"/>
            <p>Then live, Christopher! Ay, so I will, - you may trust me. - Hands off! come down legs! - I won't turn such a Turk, as to fly from the top of a tower, when I may civilly walk down stairs.</p>
            <p>Which I did, and read the inscription round what I had been on the top of - This protestant city, &amp;c. O how envy grins there out of hell, to see it rebuilt, and florishing again? - I'll undertake to know a Jesuit, by bringing him to the monument and pointing up to those words, as easily as the devil by his cloven foot. - Look how he scowls and frets, and swears 'tis all as loud a lye as Gunpowder-treason!</p>
            <p>Let him fret his gills out if he thinks fit, while Christopher steps down to the Old-Swan, and takes water. - Stay, - but 'tis against tide, - what if the mills should suck him in? well considered. - An elder brother's thread is generally twisted very delicately. - I have just declared against such a long ramble. - I'll ot the</p>
            
            <pb n="98" xml:id="pb-98" facs="#i102"/>
            <p>Stillyard - The tide runs strong - 'Tis good to be sure - Come, the Three-Cranes is but a little further - or Queen-Hithe - And now I'm here, 'tis but edging to Black-Friar's stairs, and then there's no danger; Ay, now let's see - sure now we're safe - ben't we waterman? - See how the rogue laughs - but he does not know my value as well as I do, and what a loss the world would have if Christopher Wagstaff should be the food of fishes.</p>
            <p>- So, 'tis very well, the boat is trim'd now - do ye see the bridge - what a thing it is - a street of flying houses - not quite so large though as that Jesuitical-bridge in China, which father Kircher tells us of, from one mountain to another, above a mile long, and I have forgot how many broad - but however such a bridge as a man had better go over than put off his stockings and shoes to wade through the river; though in truth 'tis a dangerous</p>
            
            <pb n="99" xml:id="pb-99" facs="#i103"/>
            <p>place, for there are pick-pockets innumerable, almost as many as run drops of water under in a day - Therefore I'd advise every prudent man, who has any business in Southwark, if he has any charge of money about him, to leave it with the first beggar he meets at this end of the street, and call for it as he comes back again; or, if he be not in haste, any other time when he comes that way.</p>
            <p>You waterman - Triton - element-thresher, hold water there, and land me at New Thames-Street, for I've a mind to go meditate in St. George's Fields for a quarter of an hour, and meet me again at Lambeth without fail for I intend (next chapter) to go to see the tombs at Westminster.</p>
            
            <pb n="100" xml:id="pb-100" facs="#i104"/>
            <p>CHAP. XXIII.</p>
            <p>The author begs the favour of the reader's company to the city of Westminster.</p>
            <p>SO much at present for the famous city of London; which we will take a farther view of by and by. I love variety; I had never travelled else.</p>
            <p>I am passionately fond of new ways and paths; else was I contented to drudge on in the old hum-drum way of describing cities, beginning at one end, and proceeding regularly to the other, how much more easily might I finish this might task? - But this is not my mark; I am for mixing the pleasant, the profitable, and the surprising together; and therefore I take this agreeable and unexpected method. I begin at the 'Change, thence step to the Tower, then to the Monument - from thence half</p>
            
            <pb n="101" xml:id="pb-101" facs="#i105"/>
            <p>out of the world; then into it again, next to the water-side - And now any man would have thought I proposed taking a survey of all the palaces and buildings along the shore, the Temple, Somerset-house, Savoy, Northumberland-house, White-hall, and so to Westminster - No - This any one besides me would have done - But I take another method, or rather no method at all. - Away I walk meditating, as I told you before, and meet the waterman (without calling in to hear some certain prayers for some certain person), and then fowse - in I come upon Westminster before you ever dream'd of me.</p>
            <p>This antient and noble city of Westminster, which was built near a plat of ground formerly called Thorney, from the brakes and thorns which then covered it, is now illustrious for its buildings, famous for its inhabitants, and render'd populous and remarkable by its seats of</p>
            
            <pb n="102" xml:id="pb-102" facs="#i106"/>
            <p>law, and courts of justice - Now by this grave period, does the reader think I'm going to transcribe Stow, or some wise fellow or other who has written the history of Westminster - That very ugly or unhandsome reflection on me Christopher Wagstaff, Gent. (stand out of the way there) who never yet coloured old books, or new-bound 'em, to make them pass for originals, has altered my resolution; and you shan't hear one word more of the antiquity of this city, its founder, or any thing else but what I please; for sure I'm the master of my own subject, and may handle it as I chuse. - Don't let the reader trouble me with so many impertinent objections; for these unavoidably lead a man into digressions from the main subject; and then these digression lead a man into farther digressions; for error is infinite, and the longer you wander in a wrong path, my shoes to yours, the further you go</p>
            
            <pb n="103" xml:id="pb-103" facs="#i107"/>
            <p>from the right, especially if they are opposite one to t'other. Not but that digressions are so far from being always faults, that they are indeed often pardonable, and sometimes a great beauty in any discourse. - But then they must be well turned and managed, they must come in naturally and easily and seem to be almost of a piece with the main story, tho' they be never so far distant from it. - I love a digression, I must confess, with all my heart, because 'tis so like a ramble - but all this while what's a digression to Westminster? - Very much, for Westminster itself is but one great digression from London, as St. James's from that, Kensington from that, Hammersmith from that, Brentford from that, Hounslow-heath from that, (never fear, I'll find it again, tho' you shou'd turn me loose blindfold into the middle of the common) Salisbury from that, (that digression's rather long than not) Exeter from that, (longer still) the Mount in</p>
            
            <pb n="104" xml:id="pb-104" facs="#i108"/>
            <p>Cornwall from that, (longest of all) - the Channel, Plymouth, Torbay, Portsmouth, Beachy, Deal, Dover, Thames-mouth, Graves-end, Mile-end, from the Mount, - and so I have almost brought both ends of the city together, and you home again, before you could well crack the claw of a lobster.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XXIV.</p>
            <p>The author is gone to see the monuments in the abby. Will you step in after him?</p>
            <p>AY - there is the door - pray come in, and see the tombs, and look upon the clock-work-fellow that shews 'em - all his motions are like those of the two fierce brazen sparks at St. Dunstan's dial; there's such gravity, such extreme deliberation in the vibrations of his hand and tongue, that you'd scarce believe him made of any more active metal than the monuments he shews you.</p>
            
            <pb n="105" xml:id="pb-105" facs="#i109"/>
            <p>= Here li-eth in-terr'd (quoth he) the bo-dy of (the name worn out) great-grand-father to Al-bi-on the Great, monarch of all these real-mes, and Cor-de-li-a his wife; - Nay, - thought I, - this is the way for us to turn monuments too, if we stay here 'till all's done; so away rambled I by myself, to make new discoveries among the territories of the dead, and over looked heaps of kings, dukes, and lords, (bustling fellows, I warrant them, in their time) and scarce allow'd 'em half-an-eye; (so great is - somebody's soul) 'till whom should I meet amongst 'em all but the immortal Cowley! - Hold - here is room for contemplation - I admire the very monument. - How like is't to that great man to whose honour 'twas erected! - Here is nothing glaring and fantastic, but all proper, neat, natural, and modest; and yet a certain air it has in it altogether, that the brightest monument round can hardly equal.</p>
            
            <pb n="106" xml:id="pb-106" facs="#i110"/>
            <p>I should break out into a little extacy while weeping over his venerable ashes, and, in some passionate lines or other, tell the world its loss by the death of this excellent man. - But if Phormis durst not talk of war before Hannibal, thy very dust, O Cowley! has something in't so awful, that I dare not affront it with such poetry as mine. - However I may, I must again sacrifice some tears at thy incomparable urn - I must almost adore thee, and think that energetic spirit which ever shone thro' all thy works still hovers o'er thy precious relics, and can never ramble from them.</p>
            <p>Live then incomparable man, live both without thy tomb and in it, or rather that in thee - Thou hast, thou ever wilt have a far better and nobler monument; a mausoleum of thy own. Heroes shall learn thy Davideis, and with that ever keep thee in their breasts and memories. While love, while virtue lives, thy lambent flames shall warm the innocent</p>

            <p>virgin's bosom. An hundred ages hence shall female mortals, reading of thy mistress, envy at once, and blame that unknown fair, that made thee sign in vain - Nor shall that great name who paid this so well deserv'd honour to thy ashes be ever forgotten; nor can Buckingham want a tomb, while Cowley has one, - and while they both live in the works of Christopher Wagstaff. There's panegyric for you, which all the inscriptions in this great church can't come up to - they are all but vile prose, or paltry poesy.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXV.</p>
            <p>The editor insists upon taking occasion from this latter charge against the monumental poetry in the abby (but it ever so groundless) to insert a chapter for he use of certain MINOR POETS in these kingdoms.</p>
            <p>THERE are an inferior set of literati in the commonwealth of letters, whom I shall take leave to distinguish by the name of Half-classics. These gentlemen in the trade of wit may be said to be haberdashers of small wares. They are for every ostentatiously hanging out their trinkets and petty commodities at their doors and windows as it were, but have little or nothing substantial or valuable in their shops. They deal much in learned fragments, classical aphorisms, and proverbial sentences in all languages, and in company will fire upon you from an artillery</p>

            <p>of squibs for two or three hours together. But above all things they delight to display their art in mottos written, sculptured, or painted, upon houses, porticos, temples, arbours, utensils and moveables. &amp;c. of all kinds, which they pique themselves upon as so many standing and indelible proofs of their skill and ingenuity. I know not how to convey to the reader a truer notion of the taste of these Demi-geniuses, than by giving him a short account of the house, gardens, and domestic apparatus, of a worthy friend of mine, who has no disagreeable quality belonging to him, if this predominant foible be not one.</p>
            <p>In the front of the house, over the great door of the hall, is a bust of Jupiter hospitalis, and underneath this motto,<lb/>

            <p>- COME, let's be going - there's nothing else worth seeing that I know - Let Thyn lie where he is, 'till those who sent him thither come and weep over his tomb 'till they fetch him to life again. - Let Queen Mary rest in peace, if her conscience will let her. - Let General Monk keep possession of his closet, 'till his plaistered face be worm-eaten. - Let Doctor Busby try now to frighten Syntax into the scholars at Westminster school.

            <p>then the Alcaid - sand-hills - marine-regiments. - Well - the reader can't imagine what pains I take to curb this rambling fancy of mine to keep him company; but though I lean back to the very crupper, the jade starts, and winces about as if she had a nettle under her tail. - So - so - I'll stroke her, and see if fair means will do - She begins to be pretty civil, and walks peaceably along toward the Parliament-house, and the hall - but first let's call in at Heaven (here's a house of entertainment so called) and take a little soop by the way - that's soon done - now enter.</p>

            <p>A pretty true account of Westminster-hall taken almost VERBATIM from the author.</p>
            <p>BUT whither are we going? Here's a hold indeed - Christopher knows what to do with his life and property better than to venture upon such new discoveries - why it looks like the entry into Okey-hole, or the Devil's - of Peak. Let me see - Is't possible to get in this way without creeping upon hands and knees? Mercy on me, what black things with green wings are those that I see wandering up and down within, and appearing through the shades? - Sure they are no better than incarnate lawyers, among droves of poor deluded wretches dragging after them, out of whom they have sucked all their blood and substance, 'till they look like</p>

            <p>ghosts indeed, and miserable one's too; for all the shapes of rage, fury, despair, and revenge appear in their faces. - Well - this it is to have land and money. - Well fared old Diogenes - that happy snail, who always carried his shell about with him, and nothing else. Who ever heard he had a lawsuit with his landlord for dilapidation, or his goods seised for not paying rent, or his platters and porridge-pot for chimney money? But 'tis a known, thumb'd, sweaty proverb - All trades must live - and so must he who takes malefactors to task after the lawyers have done with them.</p>
            <p>Will no spiders live in the roof of Westminster-hall? Be it so - yet the want is pretty well made up with venemous creatures below, who croud along so thick and numerous that there's no antidote against them but an empty purse.</p>
            <p>What a whisper was this Will. Rufus, or rather what very beef-eaters have the yeomen of the guards been ever since</p>

Observe the little grates, and nooks and corners (some call them courts) round about the walls - sure they were designed for butteries, or rather cupboards to this monster of a dining room.</p>
            <p>What a hodge-podge of the world is here? Judges and bailiffs, and secondaries, and old women, and curates, and serjeants, and bishops, and young heirs, and shoes, and stockings, gloves, ribbands, rattles, and law books! - solicitors, pickpockets, attornies, whores, sempstresses, and honest women! - Hold - why hold - yes I say it, and say it again, honest women; for I was there once with Judith, and I am so charitable as to hope there might be one more virtuous one besides her.</p>

Not that I speak any ill at all of any place in the world by way of experience - no, all the world knows Christopher Wagstaff better (I mean all that do know me, and, you known, that is the same thing to me) - I protest I am so far from having any vile propensities that way, that I never speak, or think, or dream of any female between this and Turky, but my</p>

            <p>dear Judith. - You shall have her history, if you have patience, before I have finished this work. Well - 'tis wonderful how forward some young women are (I mean, in their learning, Sir) in comparison of others. - Why, Judith (as you will see when you come to the chapter) played naturally upon the spinet, the first time she saw one, and without the help of a music-master. - There was an ear for you - and a hand too if you go to that. - Well - but stay - Where am I? Ay - at Westminster. - You shall hear more of it presently. - I must just eat a bit of dinner.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXVIII.</p>
            <p>The author proceeds in his ramble through Westminster.</p>
            <p>THAT's the Gate-house - at the sign of the Flying-shoe there - see what we must all come to (to wear shoes I mean, not to angle with them)! - How many journies had this poor shoe wandered? how indefatigably had it rambled? for alas! 'twas all worn with labour, before it came to this sad condition. And yet after all, to come to beg bread in its old age! 'Tis a sad thing to think on. - And so much for my discourse upon the old shoe at debtor's college. -</p>
            <p>Well, was I a privy councellor, or a leading parliament man, among many other excellent projects which I should always be hammering out for the good</p>
            
            <pb n="121" xml:id="pb-121" facs="#i125"/>
            <p>of my country, I would certainly promote some law or other to prevent that inundation of beggars which overflow this plentiful country, and plague it more than the lice did Egypt; - for sure beggars with lice are worse grievance than lice without beggars.</p>
            <p>Towards so great and desirable an end that prince of most sweet hopes, King Edward VI. and this famous city (I mean the other city, for this is Westminster) have both proposed a very proper method, and given a glorious example.</p>
            <p>They first sorted the poor into several distinct ranks and orders, or, as some say, ordures; - the poor by poverty, casualty, and wickedness. For the first sort they set apart (besides many other particular alms-houses founded by particular persons and companies) Christ church hospital, where so vast a number of fatherless children of both sexes are so handsomely provided for:</p>
            
            <pb n="122" xml:id="pb-122" facs="#i126"/>
            <p>For the second - the hospitals of St. Thomas in Southward, and St. Bartholomew in Smithfield:</p>
            <p>For the third - Bridewell, the most necessary of all the three.</p>
            <p>But now was I worthy to shoot my fool's bolt, I should think there's yet very much wanting towards regulating this famous city, and after their example the whole kingdom.</p>
            <p>The first and main thing conducive to such a great end, would be a strict and just execution of the excellent laws in being against vagrants and vagabonds, gypsies, and other strolling ramblers, who equally impose upon and injure their country.</p>
            <p>How many hundreds (We might perhaps add another cypher) are there about London, whose whole business it is to maintain themselves at the expence of the public? What numbers are there who are enabled not only to live, but to live well too, by the contributions of</p>
            
            <pb n="123" xml:id="pb-123" facs="#i127"/>
            <p>such who don't understand giving from charity? - Were there public work-houses provided to employ those sort of people, men, women, and children (for some sort of work even the last would be capable of) how much more honour, and strength, and profit, would thence accrue to the city and nation?</p>
            <p><note>Manicule</note>â Very true, very true, Mr. Wagstaff - but rather dull than not - Let's see - what's next? "For those who are really incapable -" - That will never do - I must e'en go to another paragraph - Oh! - we shall have something new here. -</p>
            <p>But to consider a little the case of those miserable wretches whom the sight of the old shoe puts me in mind of - the prisoners for debt - with submission to the policy of almost all mankind and all ages, it seems an odd sort of a piece of justice to inflict the heaviest penalty next to that of death itself, namely, perpetual imprisonment, upon</p>
            
            <pb n="124" xml:id="pb-124" facs="#i128"/>
            <p>misfortunes in many cases rather than crimes, and that for no wise end, or with a view to any good to be obtained by it.</p>
            <p>If one rogue runs away with a great part of my estate; if another breaks, or another fires my house, and ruins me - is it reasonable that for these miseries I must endure others, and be confined to a stinking dungeon all the days of my life, because I am so unhappy as to be in debt against my will? - And then of those who are imprisoned in this manner, is there one in ten who ever pays any thing the more? - Nay do not this frequently, make men desperate, and careless whether ever they come out again, or what they spend while they are there?</p>
            <p>These as much deserve pity and charity, as another sort censure and punishment, who, when they have estates or lucrative employments, careless lavish all away in leud or riotous living; or a</p>
            
            <pb n="125" xml:id="pb-125" facs="#i129"/>
            <p>second sort, who by their folly, heedlessness, and neglect of business and accounts, waste away their substance insensibly; or a third, more wicked than both, who get whatever goods or monies they can possibly scrape together, and then turn bankrupts, and run into prison as into garrison with all the spoils of numbers of innocent individuals, and industrious families inevitably ruined.</p>
            <p>These last are infinitely worse than robbers upon the highway; and, I think, deserve, therefore, at least the same punishment - But the only speedy way to prevent their villainy would be effectually to root out all those sanctuaries where they lurk - the Mint, White-friars, &amp;c. - For would any foreigner believe, that the wise and excellent constitution of the English government would allow of places within its bosom where it has no power, where its writs and officers are no more regarded than they would be in Japan or China?</p>
            
            <pb n="126" xml:id="pb-126" facs="#i130"/>
            <p>For the other sorts of bankrupts, made so either by carelessness or riot - it might not, perhaps, be amiss if the prudent custom of some nations were enfranchised here - namely, that of examining how every person lives at every year's end by public censors to that end appointed, at least how all such do, as are justly suspected either of sloth or debauchery - To such as offended on the worst side of the two, after admonition, corporal punishment might be usefully administered - For the other, a little more labour might in a great measure very much alter affairs in a few years, nor should we in all likelihood have our prisons so full, or our shops and houses so empty.</p>
            <p>Well - if the world laughs and looks asquint at all this grave council, and these painful thoughts which I have laid up together for their advantage not mine, why then - they be not worthy of it, and there's an end; and so I will</p>

            <p>ramble on to somewhat else, after I have dropped four farthings into the old shoe I was talking of, and then left it, 'tis like, a penny better than I found it. - between this and the Privy-garden, I went by a house where I heard a noise as loud as if a detachment from the infernal regions had taken possession of the mansion. On enquiring into the matter of a sober citizen, who seemed to be an unwilling auditor of this diabolical uproar, I was told the Bacchanalian club were assembled at the house aforesaid, and that they held that night their quarterly meeting. - Upon which I took to my heels in order to get out of the purlieus of such unworshipful society.</p>
            
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i132"/>
            <p>CHAP. XXIX.</p>
            <p>A chapter of the editor's concerning CLUBS, with an account of a modern one, is seasonably inserted here.</p>
            <p>IT would, I imagine, be of little or no present use to inquire into the antiquity of clubs, or how far our modern institutions, which are called by this name, bear resemblance to the symposia of the antients. 'Tis at least certain that, altho' these societies be allowed to be of classical original, the plans of them have been greatly enlarged and improved, and the laws and rules by which they are governed, rendered more clear, precise, and coercive, by the joint wit and wisdom of late generations. If the Spectator (who in vol. I. no. 9 gives us an account of several nocturnal assemblies of this sort, and particularly of a two-penny club, of which he transcribes the</p>
            
            <pb n="129" xml:id="pb-129" facs="#i133"/>
            <p>rules and orders) mentions these little establishment as things agreeable and useful in his days, what would that price of essayists say to the wonderful improvements of the present age upon this important article of social life? What heretofore have been the main ends and designs of these institutions, we may learn from the following passage of that vivacious writer, (did you ever hear Mr. Addison called so before?_ in the paper just referred to. "When men, says he, are thus knit together, by a love of society, not a spirit of faction, and don't meet to censure or annoy those that are absent, but to enjoy each other, when they are thus combined for their own improvement, or for the good of others, or at least to relax themselves from the business of the day, by an innocent and chearful conversation, there may be something very useful in these little institutions and establishments." But how far beyond all this</p>
            
            <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i134"/>
            <p>have these societies in our days extended their views, privileges, and constitutions? They undertake the cognizance of all national matters, as well as ecclesiastical as civil; and, as parliaments and convocations represent the clergy and commons of England, these meetings may be said in some measure to represent convocations and parliaments. As if the old school-maxim were reversed, and it now run -</p>
            <p><note>Latin</note> Omne minus continet in se majus; -</p>
            <p>they enact laws, alter or repeal statues, and rectify and reform abuses and grievances in church, state, and trade. What real influence they may have out of the bounds of their several fraternities, or whether any inconveniences may possibly arise to the government, from their thus assuming in a manner, and acting in a legislative capacity, I undertake not to ascertain; and shall observe only, that, abstractedly at least considered,</p>
            
            <pb n="131" xml:id="pb-131" facs="#i135"/>
            <p>such a plan is in itself of a noble, generous, and public-spirited nature, and that the members of these several little communities do generally value themselves as men of very great consequence accordingly. Some time ago, upon my asking a neighbour of mine to go with me to the opera, he in obliging terms told me he was sorry he could not attend me, but that he was under particular engagement at club the same evening, in order to assist at the repeal of the uniformity act. - Upon further inquiry I found the society of which my friend was a worthy member confined their debates and determinations wholly to religious matters; and consequently as they avowedly act upon none but protestant principles, there is no great danger of their doing a prejudice to the body politic. - The famous Robin Hood society, now or late in being, was universally acknowledge long since to be an innocent, laudable, and useful institution;</p>
            
            <pb n="132" xml:id="pb-132" facs="#i136"/>
            <p>which, in this land of liberty and good sense, (as somebody very judiciously calls it) has asserted the original rights of nature and reason, against the insolent impositions and invasions of grown-men, and others, who had long taught mankind to pace in the slavish trammels of church authority. - However the club above mentioned seems, if possible, to be erected upon a plan more noble, useful, and extensive than even this. - As my friend favoured me with a sight of the laws and orders made for the regulation and good government of this society, I shall transcribe as many of them as will be sufficient to convince the reader of the nature and excellence of this new institution.</p>

            <p>LAWS and RULES to be observed by the members of the RATIONAL SOCIETY, lately erected in vindication of the rights of nature, and for the support and preservation of true religion and good manners in this metropolis.</p>

            In case of a competition for the chairman-ship, the preference shall be given to the candidate who hath published any book or pamphlet in defence of the principles of this society, or against any received doctrine or usage of the church of England. And, if both the candidates are authors, the contest shall be determined by ballot.</p>
            <p>VI.<lb/>

            <pb n="136" xml:id="pb-136" facs="#i140"/>
            <p>XII.<lb/>

            Every gentleman shall, upon his admission into this society, give it under his hand, that he will exert his best endeavours, in his sphere and capacity, for the procuring a general liberty of conscience, and exemption from the laws, commonly called, divine, throughout these kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Such are the principal rules and laws of the society I have been speaking of, from which a reasonable conjecture may be formed of the importance and excellency of its institution. - As the worthy gentlemen who constitute this weekly assembly, seem to be unanimously agreed in their general sentiments and principles,</p>

            <p>it is not so clear what are the subjects of their debates; but it may be presumed, these turn either upon the ways and means of accomplishing the great and salutary ends of their institution; or probably upon the ceremonies, punctilios, by-laws, and regulations of the fraternity; or perhaps upon the rules and maxims of honour which are to take place when those of the christian religion shall be happily repealed.</p>
            <p>My friend informs me the club-room is adorned with handsome portraits of Mr. T-l, Mr. T-d, Mr. Ch-b, the author of the Life of King DAVID, &amp;c. &amp;c. and many other wits and philosophers who have signalized themselves by their learned, subtle, and judicious writings in defence of truth, and infidelity. - Herein the society no doubt had the Ugly club in their eye, mentioned by the Spectator, vol. I, no. 17, whose club-room was embellished with the heads of AEsop, Scarron, Hudibrass, and Thersites, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>WELL, we are now come to the Privy-garden; and pray, was not that king's jester a merry fellow, who sold this pretty little spot of ground, and that country 'squire a very country 'squire who bought it of him, to build houses upon?</p>

York-palace - as it might have been afterwards when King Charles the Second lived in it (i.e. if King Charles the Second had pleased) as well as before King Henry the Eighth, being burnt out of house and home at Westminster, remov'd his lodgings thither.</p>
            <p>Every one in his way; let those who understand architecture admire the galleries, the banqueting-house, or new lodgings, which perhaps may be snug and convenient enough; - let others admire the pleasant new whirligig of a weather-cock, erected before the prince of Orange landed, that all well-wishers to their country might see when a protestant</p>

            <p>well as his brother, he would never have quitted this mansion, and all this excellent fare, to dine with the king of France upon broth and garden stuff, and almost starve his once royal body, without making his soul the fatter for it! - Well - the Roman catholic religion is too lean an one for me - and yet many of your papists, by some contrivance or other, are pretty crummy one's too - Did you ever read of a cardinal that died of a consumption? Well - I only ask the question - I tell you, I don't want to enter into a dispute about it. - Good morrow to you. - What do you think of a walk in St. James's Park? - Agreed - it is a curious place that's the truth of it. - Sir, the canal, the carriages, the the statue, the owls, the walks, the Mall, the ladies, and fine gentlemen I saw there, quite dazzled my eyes, and put my modest out of countenance. - So I e'en run the gantlet through them all, and made the best of my way to Charring-cross.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXX.</p>
            <p>The just-mentioned incident gives the editor an opportunity to recommend to the perusal of every true Briton, the following chapter - upon paste and patriotism.</p>
            <p>IT must give every true lover of his country infinite pleasure at this time to observe, how amazingly the spirit of patriotism hath of late diffused itself among all orders of men and women, and especially those of rank, birth, and fortune. Whatever foundation of complaint there may be against the debauchery, licentiousness, corruption, and carnality of the age, I defy the greatest cynic in religion, or morals, to produce a period in all our history wherein this noble and virtuous spirit has been so universally prevalent as it is at this day. Indeed (with submission to every theologist appertaining to the tabernacle in</p>

            <p>Moor-fields, from the preacher to the door-keeper, I speak it) our very vices, luxuries, and extravagancies are, in this respect, so far from being reproachable, (and therefore, by the bye, it is hard they should be damnable in any) that they to a great degree cherish and promote that national ardor, which a set of too sober, hum-drum, and musty maxims and morals would serve only to discourage and depress. How many pipes, hogsheads, barrels, kilderkins, and bottles of liquors of all colours, qualities, and denominations, have been exhausted within this year or two (to go no farther back) in copious potations to that glorious constitutional toast, - Success to the arms of Great-Britain! -</p>

            <p>the head of the British cavalry. - In truth, next to the worthy personages, who, as we may say, are actively in the service of their country, by sea or land, and venturing limb and life in the defence of it, those deserve to be held in esteem and veneration, who are optatively so, and by all peaceable and domestic methods possible express their zeal for its reputation and glory.</p>
            <p>I am credibly informed, a hearty anti-gallican gentleman in the country made as many of his tenants and neighbours dead-drunk with old beer, upon confirmation of the news of the reduction of Martinico, as there were Englishmen slain upon that occasion. - I own, I see not how he could have paid a handsomer compliment to these defunct int he bed of honour, unless he had so contrived matters that his jolly victims had died under so patriotic an intoxication! - Surely it must be a comfortable and animating consideration to</p>

            <p>our military gentlemen abroad, to be told, how laudably their fellow subjects at home intermix national and public spirited principles with their diversions, enjoyments, and festivities; and to what a degree of emulation they eat, and drink, and dance for their country! - A-la-Martinique is, it is said, become the favourite minuet in every genteel assembly in and near town; - and, I am told, an eminent master is composing a new set of country dances, all against the French and Spaniards. - But what give the highest idea of the elegance and magnificence, as well as the sincerity, of modern patriotism, are those spectacles which have been exhibited at public entertainments, in which all the efforts of wit, judgment, and paste, have been exerted to represent in eatable materials the many defeats of our enemies, and the triumphs of the British flag. - It is not long since we had the agreeable and important news of the</p>
            
            <pb n="147" xml:id="pb-147" facs="#i151"/>
            <p>taking of Belleisle at the table of a nobleman of the first rank and taste, who hath long greatly distinguished himself by treating for the benefit of this nation! - This example has been followed with equal zeal and success; and it may be presumed, under the influence of this noble spirit the art of pastry will be soon brought to still greater perfection. - I am informed a very ingenious pastry-cook in the Strand hath a design of baking the whole house of Bourbon in a rich pie, to be served up at the Lord M-y-r's table the next publick feast; and that a brother artist has formed a still grander project of representing by his plaster power a sea-fight between the English fleet and those of France and Spain, and of actually blowing up the latter by means of some scented gunpowder artificially disposed; and that, in order to prevent the confusion and terror so unexpected a shock might probably occasion among the ladies, a signal</p>

            <p>is to be given from the British admiral's ship a few minutes before the intended explosion. - I am aware, it has been said by certain disaffected, or mean-spirited people, who love their money better than they do their country, that the extravagance and profusion of these publick feasts is absolutely unseasonable; and that it must give every prudent and considerate man pain to reflect, that, whereas not many years ago a worthy brewer and magistrate in an opulent city of this kingdom hath been seen, even during his m-y-r-lty and in time of profound peace, eating a beef-steak, value at most 1s. of his own broiling, at an ale-house, for his dinner; one of his successors hath expended near 2000l. upon a single meal in the time of a tedious, bloody, and expensive war! What a ridiculous calumny is this! I would just ask one of these discontented gentlemen, Whether, when the king of France is informed of our patriotic entertainments, he will not be</p>

            <p>led to conclude, either that the subjects of this kingdom are so wealthy that they will be able to support the present war an hundred years longer, or that they will soon be so extremely indigent that they will not be worth the conquering? and whether either of these notions must not in its consequences be salutary to Great-Britain? - In short, I am by all means for encouraging this spirit of animosity against the French in my countrymen whether drunk or sober; and think I cannot better conclude than with an anecdote relating to an honest friend of mine, who a few mights ago, being a little inebriated with drinking confusion to our enemies over the water, fell down among a heap of rubbish near the new building in ***. In this situation he was accidentally found by a French valet, who civilly offered him his assistance. My friend had sense enough to discover what he was, and bid him go about his business for a French son of a bitch:</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXXII.</p>
            <p>The author's account of a bookseller's shop.</p>
            <p>NEXT door tot he cook lived a bookseller; so that after a man had filled his belly, it was but going a step farther to this shop, and he might give his mind a meal, if he had any craving that way. - You know I foreswore the inside of a book one volume and many chapters ago; and yet I could not help taking a snap or so at a few title pages that lay temptingly under the window. - Methought, many people that pass by may take me for a scholar, when they</p>

            <p>see me here; and as great a fool as I am, I have no need to let every apprentice in London know it. - You have heard of - han't you? - Well then I'll tell you. - As a certain reverend doctor was going along the street, says a gentleman to an arch wag that stood by him - pray mind that solemn, grave, hatchet-faced old fellow; and yet to my knowledge he is an arrant dunce, and knows no more of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew than a dray-horse. - 'Tis no matter, replied the other; if he can but hold his tongue and keep that countenance, he will look like a schoalr in the learnedst company in Christendom. - Now this very doctor's face in miniature I endeavoured to put on at the bookseller's window. - Pray, Sir, have you never done the like? Well, but now let us see hat we have got here. - Here seems to be as great a variety of intellectual food as there was of carnal at the other house - a book of devotions - tracts political - poems on several</p>

            <p>occasions - the whole duty of man - the Roman history - What a hash of religion, politicks, poetry, and history is here! - The abdicated prince, or the adventures of four years; a tragi-comedy, as it was lately acted at court by several persons of great quality - The late revolution, or the happy change; an historical play, as it was acted throughout the English dominions in the year 1688 - The royal voyage, or the Irish expedition; a tragi-comedy, as it is now acting in Ireland by the chief officers in his majesty's army - A full and impartial account of the several contest and disputes among the wits of the last century. - Heyday, I could not help muttering, cannot your wits agree among themselves! - Not always, young man, cried a subtle fellow, I warrant him, who happened to overhear me: But I'll tell you a secret - this bookseller here has for some time employed two authors to write against each other upon a certain subject, with as much spleen</p>

            <p>and animosity as the d-v-l or the pope bears against Martin Luther; and yet once a month they very lovingly settle accounts together, and go snacks int he profits of the controversy. - Nay then, thought I , if there is so much roguery among your wits, an honest fool has no occasion to be ashamed of himself; and so I took leave of these sham-combatants, and came away about my business.</p>

            <p>The author proceeds in his history and observations.</p>
            <p>MY book's almost done; I find the bulk grows upon me; and yet I've almost three quarters of London to survey; - therefore away rambled I from Charing-cross as fast as if I had been mounted behind his majesty himself a-top of his black courser - and a </p>

            <p>little faster, for I've a fancy I can walk better than that beast, tho' scarce leap so well - for 'twas a terrible way from a deep cellar, I know not how many yards under ground, to skip up higher than a balcony.</p>
            <p>I trotted on about a quarter of an hour longer 'till I came to Somerset house; and being neither justice of peace, nor knight, I ventur'd in among 'em.</p>
            <p>"'Tis a curious pile of buildings, erected by Edward, duke of Somerset, uncle to king Edward the Sixth, in the year 1549. It has a pleasant, tho' small garden, and some walks between that and the water's side, on which it's very delectably seated," as a certain historian kindly informs us, and as you may see, if you'll take a pair of oars and go thither.</p>
            <p>And pray do, for you'll have the advantage into the bargain of a view of the Savoy - that famous school of the Jesuits, to whom some (you may guess how) good</p>

            <p>Protestants sent their children to be instructed (no Protestant or Englishman having learning enough for 'em) by that wonderful scholar Poulton, whose wit was so great, and memory so little, that he forgot the names of his own popes!</p>
            <p>- Ah! poor catholics! what pains they took! how they sweated and tugged for their Dagon, while they were here! what seminaries and schools were they - like to have established! and after all, to be extirpated on and all, bag and baggage! - this was hard fortune; much harden than they deserved, who were so tender-hearted and indulgent towards Hereticks, that they never attempted to blow them up, or set fire to their houses, above once or twice in one age! - let 'em go - we shall find some of them again at Wild-house; - but first suppose we step to the May-pole. - Alas! poor creature - how art thou humbled! - thou who wast as high as a steeple, and wert almost long enough to have made a</p>

            <p>walking-staff for the city's guardian angel as he rambled 'cross the clouds! - Thou hast worst luck than all the city besides thee - thus is age despised! - for whereas that is risen three or four stories higher, thou art taken down much lower than thou wert when thou wast first erected.</p>
            <p>I won't say the world's honester, for Christopher won't lie, but I'm confident 'tis wiser than 'twas formerly. Was it not fine work for one company of hot-headed fools to set up this stripling of a May-pole, and make a wooden god of him, singing and dancing, and not rarely fighting, and fudling, and whoring in his honour? - and were not another crew very discreetly zealous who made war against May-poles (and Bear-baitings), with as much earnestness aud vigour as they'd have done against Turk and Pope, flashing and hewing the innocent timber where e'er they came near it? - But now neither are people so mad for or against</p>

            <p>it; but, as the poor justice said upon the point, - they that will have a May-pole shall have a May-pole, and they who won't may let it alone. - Well - as I was staring at the May-pole, comes by a fine coach, with a figure in it which I took at first for painted wood or wax, but was presently told 'twas one of the Court-ladies. - Lord! said I to myself, if this is a woman, what must my Judith be?</p>

            <p>The editor is put in mind, by the last circumstance in the last chapter, of a letter received lately by a friend of his in the country from a relation at present in town, which, tho' relative to a character often delineated by masterly hands, hath, he apprehends, a peculiarity in it that will be acceptable to such of his readers as are enemies to affectation.</p>
            <p>"Dear Harry.<lb/>
            I Have been long enough in this polite town to be heartily tired of it. You was never more mistaken than when you told me the night before my journey, I was going into the world. Properly speaking, my friend, I am got out of it. The fine people in these quarters have times, seasons, customs, manners, sentiments, pleasures, anxieties, and sensations, peculiar</p>
            <pb n="159" xml:id="pb-159" facs="#i163"/>
            <p>to themselves; and in respect of these are a kind of antipodes to all the rest of the creation. - You must know, the capital point of high life is neither to say, think, or act, like other folks. A true-bred fine lady would not eat, drink, or sleep, as we do, if she could help it. In consequence of this, excepting in the articles of dress, cards, routs, operas, and one or two more, she is very ignorance; or at least, seems desirous to be thought so. - Pray, my lord, which way is the wind? said a lady yesterday at a table where I had the honour to dine; - well - positively I could never tell which way the wind was in my life. - I cannot convey to you a truer notion of general life, than by giving you a full and particular account of this very fine lady. - <note>Latin</note>Ex una disce omnes. - It was by much the warmest day we have had this year; and yet upon the door's being accidentally left open about two seconds,</p>

            <p>she solemnly declared, she should be starved to death. - Upon her ordering the coach, she was told the coachman was very much disordered with a pain in his head; - this she maintained to be impossible, for to be sure such a creature as he could never have the headach. - She almost blinded herself with reading two pages that very morning, and had it not been for the assistance of the smelling-bottle would have actually fainted that afternoon, because two chairmen had high words in the square. - Every language but the French and Italian, she thinks odious and barbarous; for, in her opinion, there is no talking out of the one, or singing out of the other. - According to her ideas of things, they are the most insignificant and contemptible people breathing who don't eat off plate, or burn wax candles, or who dine before five o'clock; as, in her religious system, he is the most abominable</p>

            <p>and wicked wretch, who tears a fan, spills a dish of tea, or drops a snuff-box. - Mrs. ***, said she, is a good sort of a woman enough, but a very poor animal, a mere nothing, an insipid spiritless creature; or, in other words, as I found upon enquiry, she pays her tradesmen, teaches her own daughters to work, and goes to church twice every Sunday! - Her vexations and her satisfactions are equally extraordinary, and eccentrical; - if a pin happens to be misplaced in her dress, she is tormented to distraction with that thing her woman; or, if a noble peer does himself the honour to drink her health at dinner, she is infinitely obliged to him! - She sends once a quarter, at least, to her physician, to know whether she is not out of order; and goes as regularly to Bath every season, as the judges do the circuits. - She is excellently well described, in the old rum book which the house-keeper</p>
            
            <pb n="162" xml:id="pb-162" facs="#i166"/>
            <p>has upstairs, under the character of - the tender and delicate woman, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness. - She is a thing almost wholly passive; constantly fatigued with doing nothing, and frequently in motion, by the help of her equipages, without stirring a limb. - Indeed, such is her daintiness that she may not improperly be said to be a sufferer even in her pleasures! - She would go to church in warm weather sometimes, but there is so much low company, and the sermons are so long, and the prayers so tedious, that there is no bearing it; and besides she is at present quite our of humour with the parson of the parish, whom she looks upon as a precise, formal fellow, because he refused to christen one of her ladyship's children with orange-flower-water. - She says wittily, the Black-boys (meaning the clergy) in England,</p>
            
            <pb n="163" xml:id="pb-163" facs="#i167"/>
            <p>are a set of as troublesome, impertinent fellows, as the White-boys, or Levellers, that have lately infested the kingdom of Ireland. - She has no notion of the religion of the vulgar, and longs to see a short, elegant form of prayer drawn up for the use of the quality! -</p>
            <p>By this time you have, I suppose, enough of my fine lady, and may have some idea of the felicity of a life which principally consists in negatives; - in eating and drinking without appetite; - in laughing without being pleased; - in spending time without using it; - in contracting a numerous acquaintance without making one friend; - in shew without substance; - and in pleasure without satisfaction. - You will guess how impatient I am under the polite restraints my engagement at my Lord -'s keeps me, and desirous of bringing our matters to conclusion,</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXXVI.</p>
            <p>The editor takes occasion here to write a chapter of advice, or instruction to two very different sorts of people.</p>
            <p>WHERE was you last night? - said I to an acquaintance of mine, who is a passionate admirer of Mr. Garrick. - I was at the play; I went to see Garrick act *****. - Well; what do you think of that play? - Faith I know very little about the play - Garrick's</p>
            
            <pb n="169" xml:id="pb-169" facs="#i173"/>
            <p>performance was inimitable, that's all I know. - Garrick's performance! what is that to the plot, the sentiment, and the diction, &amp;c. of the Drama itself? I should be glad to know something of these. - Should you? then you may read it; for to tell you the truth, when Garrick was off the stage, I was eating oranges, and looking round the house - There were several pretty women in the front boxes. -</p>
            <p>Now I am apt to think, numbers of gentlemen frequent the theatres with the same taste and upon the same principles with this friend of mine. - there are, no doubt, and ever will be different degrees of merit in the several performers upon any stage whatever; but this merit if absolutely distinct from that of the written performance; and he who pays no regard but to the personal qualification of actors must in course be incapable of that improvement and rational entertainment, which the Drama, as such, is calculated to bestow.</p>
            
            <pb n="170" xml:id="pb-170" facs="#i174"/>
            <p>It is in truth with wonder to be observed, that an audience will often fix their attention most absurdly, not only on a favourite actor, but on any thing else which is excellent in its kind, on a song, a dance, or a scene, and sit in a manner indifferent to every other theatrical transaction. - Among all its rants and extravagancies, Nat. Lee's Rival Queens abounds with lessons or morality; but these are all absolutely lost upon a set of people who repair to Covent Garden, when this play is acted there, with no other view but to see Alexander make his triumphant entry into Babylon! - What numbers flocked to this house the last season to see the CORONATION upon the same principle, though every man of candor will allow the monarchal character was by no means injured by the representations of Mr. Smith? - The taste for this spectacle is really amazing. It was not long since a gentleman in a company, of which I was one, intimated</p>
            
            <pb n="171" xml:id="pb-171" facs="#i175"/>
            <p>an intention of the manager of this theatre to revive Sir Richard Steel's comedy of the Funeral; upon which my next-chair neighbour cried out - I hope we shall have the CORONATION with it! - I have before now observed a numerous and polite andience, after having sat with impatience through three acts of an excellent tragedy, beholding with transport a company of foreign dancers, whose whole and sole merit perhaps it was never to be OUT at heels. - Did you never hear a call of the house upon Mr. Beard for the EARLY HORN, in the intervals of a play, so loud and vehement, that you was inclined to believe the dramatic princes, heroes, counsellors, queens, and countesses of that evening to be persons of very little consequence?</p>
            <p>I need not pursue these reflections farther; but cannot help adding upon this subject, that players, or rather managers ought to take all possible care</p>
            
            <pb n="172" xml:id="pb-172" facs="#i176"/>
            <p>that they do not themselves by indiscretion (which has been sometimes the case) abet and encourage, in some measure at least, that very inattention and indifference I have been taking notice of. This care, it is plain, consists in many particulars; but in nothing, I apprehend, more than in the judicious casting of the parts in a play, as the gentlemen of the stage phrase it. It has been usual to measure the excellence of a character rather by the length, than the dignity of it: And indeed it is right so to do, provided that even appearances are saved at the same time, and that no character of eminence and quality, if I may so say, be disgraced by a contemptible representative. Inferior characters (considered as parts) should never be assigned at random; and a proper regard ought to be always had to the figure of theatrical personages. The part of Othello, or of Iago, requires the talents of a Garrick; but does it therefore follow, that the</p>
            
            <pb n="173" xml:id="pb-173" facs="#i177"/>
            <p>Duke of Venice may be decently represented by a candle-snuffer? I have myself, in my time, seen, at the Theatres ~Royal, many persons of great name, both in antient and modern history, creeping along the stage with their hands in their pockets, like taylors. - These improprieties call to my mind a glaring one I was once witness of in a country town, where Julius Caesar was acted but a company of itinerant comedians. The principal parts, those of Brutus, Cassius, and Antony, were tolerably well performed; but it gave me a kind of comical disgust to see the noble conspirator, Cassius, upon his knees, and humbly making the following petition,</p>
            <p>Pardon, Caesar, pardon; -<lb/>
            As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>to a one-ey'd fidler, who, upon this occasion, unhappily represented the emperor of the world. - Great indulgencies are due to the necessities of such vagrant</p>
            
            <pb n="174" xml:id="pb-174" facs="#i178"/>
            <p>performers; and therefore I take leave to publish this anecdote only by way of hint to the upper houses! - I will finish with remarking, that as the players cannot be too careful on their side to engage and keep up the attention of their audiences, by all possible means and precautions; so, on the other hand, let them be ever so deficient, good sense, fine language, and noble sentiments, are worth hearing at any time, and from any speaker.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XXXVII.</p>
            <p>Another incidental chapter by the editor, not upon plays, but upon one strange consequence of them!</p>
            <p>MANY are the arguments which have been urged pro and con upon the subject of stage-entertainments. I shall not enter here into the merits of the cause, but only declare myself to be</p>
            
            <pb n="175" xml:id="pb-175" facs="#i179"/>
            <p>in the number of those, who are advocates for them under some wanted regulations; which would render them indisputably useful to social and domestick life. However I take this argument in hand at present, not with a design to consider it in a serious or philosophical light, but with a view to certain persons, who, if they are neither morally better nor worse for their frequent attendance (I may call it) at the theatres, are yet made arrant coxcombs thereby. A kind of stage-pedantry almost totally infects their looks, manner, voice, and common conversation. They are actors in real life. The affectation I am speaking of is, by the way, very observable in players themselves, in whom it is, for the most part perhaps, rather diverting than offensive; and may in a great measure be accounted for habitually, as it were, from principles and attachments common to all professions. -</p>
            <pb n="176" xml:id="pb-176" facs="#i180"/>
            <p>The celebrated Mr. Booth was, it is said, as much a monarch off the stage, as he was on it; so that the gentleman who saw him one day going into a poulterer's shop, said humourously enough, There's King Harry the eighth cheapening a couple of rabbits. - The late Laureat's repartee, to the same gentleman, upon his desiring his assistance to help him out of the ditch he had accidentally fallen into, deserves remembering upon the same account.</p>
            <p>The gods take care of Cato.</p>
            <p>But to return to the person I have in my eye; with a short account of whose histrionic quaintness I mean to illustrate what has been advanced in the beginning of this chapter.</p>
            <p>If this gentleman happens to meet an acquaintance upon the road, or in the streets, he accosts him with,</p>
            <p>Guide of the faithful, oracle of truth,<lb/>
            Sage Mufti, hail, and welcome!</p>
            <pb n="177" xml:id="pb-177" facs="#i181"/>
            <p>Then 'tis odds but he takes him by the hand, and cries </p>
            <p>O Pylades, what's life without a friend?<lb/>
            If a tradesman brings him his bill, he look shim in the face, and repeats, - </p>
            <p>Make thy demands to those that own thy power,<lb/>
            Know I am still beyond it; -</p>
            <p>and then pays him the money.</p>
            <p>When he is at dinner, he will frequently address himself to a fricasee, or a pudding, in the following terms,</p>
            <p>Thou com'st in such a questionable shape<lb/>
            That I will speak to thee -</p>
            <p>As soon as the bottles are put upon the table, he rants like an Alexander; -</p>
            <p>Gay as the Persian god ourself will stand,<lb/>
            With a crown'd goblet in our lifted hand:<lb/>
            Young Ammon and Statira shall go round, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If he is called upon for a toast, he ushers it in with a dramatic rapture;</p>
            
            <pb n="178" xml:id="pb-178" facs="#i182"/>
            <p>O woman, lovely woman! Nature made you<lb/>
               To temper man: we had been brutes without you.<lb/>
            Angels are painted fair to look like you, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"I give you Miss ***."</p>
            <p>When he salutes a lady, a tragical transport seizes him, and he cries out; -</p>
            <p>How I could dwell for ever on those lips!<lb/>
               So soft by heaven and such a juicy sweet,<lb/>
            That ripen'd peaches have not half the flavour.</p>
            <p>If a single string of a fiddle is touched, or a key of a harpsichord, he immediately cries,</p>
            <p>If music be the food of love, play on. -<lb/></p>
            <p>Should a gentleman, in heat of wine or passion, chance to let drop an oath, he will that instant rebuke the prosaicalness of it, with a -</p>
            <p>- Whip me ye devils!<lb/>
               Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur!<lb/>
            Wash me in steep-down gulphs of liquid fire!</p>
            
            <pb n="179" xml:id="pb-179" facs="#i183"/>
            <p>When he takes his leave of his friend, he does it with the tenderness and solemnity of a Brutus: -</p>
            <p>For ever, and for ever farewell Cassius!<lb/>
               If we should meet again, then we shall smile,<lb/>
            If not, why then this parting was well made.</p>
            <p>He has frequently disturbed a whole neighbourhood, in the dead of the night, by bellowing thro' the streets,</p>
            <p>- What hoa, Brabantio!<lb/>
            Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags! -</p>
            <p>If he takes a jaunt in a post-chaise, his constant exclamation is; -</p>
            <p>Gallop apace ye fiery-footed steeds<lb/>
               To Phoebus mansion; such a waggoner<lb/>
            As Phaeton would whip you to the west, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or, if he calls for his horse at an inn, it is in the stile, and with the impetuosity, of King Richard in the tragedy: -</p>
            <p>A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.</p>
            
            
            <pb n="180" xml:id="pb-180" facs="#i184"/>
            <p>If a lady looks out of a window, as he is passing by,</p>
            <p>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun! -</p>
            <p>Or, if he sees a poor old woman upon the road, she is the witch in the Orphan. Every country looby he meets is one of Shakespear's clowns; every miller is the Miller of Mansfield; every soldier is a Serjeant Kite; every pretty girl at a public house is the Fair maid of the inn; and every landlord is mine host of the Garter! In short, he appears in more characters within the compass of a dozen hours, than Garrick himself does in a twelve-month, and of all men living has the best title to that old theatrical motto -</p>
            <p><note>Latin</note>Totus mundus agit Histrionem.</p>
            <p>This is fully sufficient to give you all an idea of him; and therefore all I shall say further of him, or to him, is this; - that, as nature, (that truly wise manager) has assigned every man his part to act</p>
            
            <pb n="181" xml:id="pb-181" facs="#i185"/>
            <p>upon the stage of human life, he who takes care not to be out in this (as they seldom will who listen to that excellent prompter, discretion) will gain more solid applause from the world than all the players that have existed from the time of Roscius to this present day.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XXXIX.</p>
            <p>The editor differs here in sentiment from the author, and humbly recommends the following chapter to the consideration of the halt, the maimed, and the blind.</p>
            <p>IT has been often mentioned, to the discredit of a very eminent surgeon, or chirurgeon (for you may depend upon it the latter is the proper word) who, pretending to have more wit than his maker, found, or thought he found, many flaws in the structure of the human body, and could have made, according to his own account, a set of guts much more suitable to every animal purpose, than what we now carry about us. This presumption very justly drew upon him the censure of all serious people, both clerks and laymen, who were unanimously of opinion that he was not half so good a christian as old Galen the</p>
            
            <pb n="184" xml:id="pb-184" facs="#i188"/>
            <p>apothecary. Had this famous adept (who of all REVIEWERS was doubtless the most impertinent) contented himself with curing instead of carping, he had deserved much better of mankind. How much more laudably have certain operators or artists of less ability, but withal of less pride than he, been of late days employed in contriving remedies against many of the infirmities that flesh is heir to, (as you know who says, to be sure) and in repairing the human fabric when brought into the most ruinous condition by age, sickness, war, or any other accident or calamity? I am confident it may be with great truth averred, that the ingenious mechanics I have in my eye (for these gentlemen undertake no case 'till the patient is happily out of the hands of the physician or surgeon) have brought their art to such perfection by the most indefatigable diligence, and understand so exactly the several parts and proportions of the human frame, that they can repair</p>
            
            <pb n="185" xml:id="pb-185" facs="#i189"/>
            <p>all damages, and supply all defects, in any living body whatever. They are, like Job, (if I may be allowed the comparison) though in a different sense, eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. They accommodate gentlemen and ladies with arms, noses, and sets of teeth, &amp;c. as they may have occasion. It is not long since I heard a brave old officer of my acquaintance declare, that of all the parts and members that belonged to his body he had not one half which he was born with; and that, one eye, one arm, and his ears excepted, he was absolutely compounded of glass, ivory, oak, and other materials. - But I know not how to do justice to this excellent art, which thus counteracts in a manner the rage of violence, and obviates the decays of nature itself, better than in the words of the following NOTICE, which an ingenious neighbour of mine, who makes limbs, &amp;c. for all this part of the town,</p>

            <p>If the world be but so just to the author, and so kind to itself, as favourably to accept this first essay of his juvenile rambles, which must of necessity be the most barren part of all, honest Christopher promises by all he values in this world, by his own honour, and by the love of Judith, to have another volume out by the latter end of next term at farthest, comprehending an exact and pleasant account of what happened to him (and many others) during his seven years' apprentiship; - of all the hardships some 'prentices endure; and of all the ways taken by men and women to ruin them; and lastly, of all the brave things the London 'prentices have</p>

            Your most obsequious<lb/>

            CHRISTOPHER WAGSTAFF.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XLI.</p>
            <p>A silly, whimsical kind of a TORY chapter by the editor. Being the most congratulaTORY, explanaTORY, dilaTORY, expostulaTORY, interrogaTORY, valedicTORY, and perempTORY chapter in all this work.</p>
            <p>GEntlemen and Ladies your most obedient! - I heartily wish you and myself joy of our arrival at the conclusion (an orator would say, peroration) of this volume. For now, you know, we have nothing to do but to talk the matter over a little, and wish one another a good night. - Pray, can</p>

            <p>any of you inform me where the REVIEWERS live? If I knew, I would certainly send them half a crown a piece by way of hush-money. - Indeed, sir, I would not - it was only a slip of my pen - I ask ten thousand pardons - (if you think in your conscience those too many, you may let me have two or three hundred of them back again) I would not be guilty of bribery and corruption in a tory chapter for the world! - Well recollected: I must go another way to work.</p>
            <p>The humble petition of, &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/>
            No - I'll see them hang'd first! - I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a description of one, i.e. of all, of these REVIEWERS, as just and elegant as any character in Clarendon, or as that of Catiline in Sallust. - Catiline, you know, was a wise fellow who undertook to review the commonwealth of Rome. -</p>
            <p>A REVIEWER, sir, is a judge of that court of inquisition, which takes authors</p>
            
            <pb n="192" xml:id="pb-192" facs="#i196"/>
            <p>to task of all ranks and denominations. He condemns and executes most unmercifully all heretics in literature, viz. all who are not of his own faith and persuasion. If they do not plead guilty, he puts them to the torture, by straining their expressions, and wrenching their meanings, to his own sense. Some he sentences to the flames; others to perpetual imprisonment in garrets, and the upper shelves in book-sellers' shops. - He is the reverse of the JUSTICE of the ancients; for, whereas she was blind, he has as many eyes as Argus; which he makes use of, not, as that cow-keeper did, for the guardship of beauties, but for the discovery of faults. He is a professor of all languages, but a master of none. He has much acrimony in him, a little wit, and less judgment. He often commends at random, and blames by caprice. He hath various forms of praise and censure by him, which he refers to and applies upon different occasions. He hath a small set of infallible</p>
            
            <pb n="193" xml:id="pb-193" facs="#i197"/>
            <p>and general rules, and hath in a manner reduced the art of criticism to mechanical principles. He is - every every thing that pride and peevishness can make him.</p>
            <p><note>Manicule</note>â I would recommend it to all authors to get this picture of a REVIEWER at full length, neatly framed and gilt, as an excellent piece of furniture over his study-chimney. - Well, Mr. REVIEWER, how do you find yourself now? Don't your bones ach after all this thumping, and beating, and bruising? Now you may guess what many a poor devil has suffered under your mutton-fists! - You will be ever with me, I warrant, for this about August - ay, about August next. -</p>
            <p>"Of all the vile, ridiculous imitations of Tristram Shandy *** -" Pshaw, pshaw, pshaw - it will never do - every thing you say must, in this case, be demonstrably dictated by passion and resentment. - You can't be supposed to be impartial.</p>
            
            <pb n="194" xml:id="pb-194" facs="#i198"/>
            <p>- I am beforehand with you. - I have nick'd you. - You must either say nothing about this performance, or speak in its praise. - I don't care one half-penny which. - Ha! ha! ha! ha! - I have a strong inclination for once to write gross, palpable nonsense, on purpose to shew all mankind how much I have you under my thumb! - Neither will I stop here; I will write epic poems, tragedies, comedies, histories, illustrations, treatises of philosophy, and what I please hereafter in spite of you.</p>
            <p>And so good-morrow to you, poor Master Reviewer! Hold - stop - hark you - one word more before you go - I intend this minute to review this work myself - So - take the aforesaid in what light you will, you need not give yourself any trouble about it. - Servant. - </p>
            <p>Courteous reader, I do upon the word of a man, and the credit of a write, give it as my firm opinion (after having carefully revised the foregoing sheets)</p>
            
            <pb n="195" xml:id="pb-195" facs="#i199"/>
            <p>that, if some few of the author's chapters had been omitted, or at least retrenched, the book would have been the better for it - I say, the book - because, in this case, the printer, with all his cunning, could never have made two volumes of this business! This is one scrape among many that Mr. Tristram Shandy has led me into. - Did you never observe the mensal interstices at an ostentatious entertainment filled up with shavings of butter, half a dozen pickled mushrooms, and two or three cucumers? But for this contrivance, you must be sensible, you could not possibly have had two courses. - The artifice is the same, the principle different, with respect to a modern publication!</p>
            <p>Dear Jack!<lb/>
            "You would have heard from me long before now had I not been employed in a comical sort of an affair,</p>
            
            <pb n="196" xml:id="pb-196" facs="#i200"/>
            <p>of which I will give you some account. - You will soon see advertised a book intitled - The Life, Travels, and Adventures, of Christopher Wagstaff, Gent. Grandfather to Tristram Shandy; of which, you must know, your humble servant is the editor. I accidentally met with it the other day under a different title, and upon perusing it found it very much like Tristram, and a thing laughable enough for this humbuggable generation. So I soon resolved to revise and correct it, and make some additions of mine own to it, and send it to the press, in order to be published in two twin volumes as soon as possible. And these additions are a strange pack of stuff indeed! They consist of separate little essays upon any subjects which came into my head, so they were funny ones. I have not a foul copy of one of them;</p>
            
            <pb n="197" xml:id="pb-197" facs="#i201"/>
            <p>for not one of them was wrote twice. You will think I hold the readers and critics of this age very cheap; and, between friends, so I do. Is there one man in a hundred can tell you why he likes Tristram Shandy? and yet, <note>Latin</note> quam sibi sortem, what luck the d-g had, as the school-boy said. Any thing queer has a chance to</p>
            <p>Hold, hold Mr. Printer, what a-duce have you been doing here? - You have been printing a private letter, which was sent you by mistake with the copy! - Well - now it is there, e'en let it stand - such a work as this, is at most but an inconsiderable article in the account of Reputation. - I wish every man who writes for his diversion, would be ingenuous enough to confess it. -</p>
            <p>Is it not hard a man can't make himself, and his neighbours merry in this</p>

            <p>way, but he shall immediately be liable to the animadversions and scoffs of a parcel of priggish fellows, who affect to consider him as an ambitious candidate for literary glory, and a rival of every white and genius since Adam? - I must have another slap at you, Messieurs. - A plague on all critics, I say still. Or suppose a poor toad writes for bread, shall an uncharitable, hard-hearted d-g of a REVIEWER give him a stone? What! - knock him o the head for being hungry? - I positively insist upon it, every honest, pains-taking man has a right to a competency, whether he be author or artificer; and I could wish to see a fund established for the maintenance and support of needy writers, that those who deserve nothing for their wit, might however be paid for their trouble!</p>
            <p>Pray, Madam, make yourself easy - I shall not detain you much longer - I have</p>
            
            <pb n="199" xml:id="pb-199" facs="#i203"/>
            <p>a word or two to say to my Printer, and then I shall take my leave.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the author hath more errata, delenda, corrigenda, and desideranda, than have yet in effect been acknowledged; - unless there be more wit or satire in him than I (or you, Sir, as sagacious as you are) can discover. - The editor likewise abounds with inelegancies, omissions, redundancies, plagiarisms, blunders, contradictions, absurdities - Hey? - you are satisfied with this confession. - Why then, you, Mr. Typographer, hold up your hand - you stand indicted for feloniously and inhumanly maiming and murdering good christian letters, and lawful grammar in the places following:</p>
            <p>Vol. i. preface, page 12, l. 14. - which accidently fell - Had this word been printed right, though but accidentally, you had got rid of one charge.</p>

            <p>Page 19, l. 5, - quasi of jesture and feature - If this blunder was made for the nonce, which I shrewdly suspect, I desire the reader to take noticed, that this is your jest, not mine.</p>
            <p>Page 24, l. 17, - the more pain the more constant - If the reader cannot make sense of this pass`age, as it now stands, 'tis to be hoped you will give him content in the next edition.</p>
            <p>Page 28, l. 11 and 18, - has so much ado - pull'd to take him. This printing is but so so; and if you had not been asleep yourself, the countryman (who was no constable) would have pulled to wake the doctor.</p>
            <p>Page 34, l. 15. - complimental productions - Sir, there is as much difference betwixt complement and compliment, as there is between hollow cask and a fall one.</p>

            <p>Vol. ii. Page 4, l. 1. - adept in Thonics - Thonics shall stand to puzzle the under-graduates of the two universities.</p>
            <p>Page 21, l. 5, - my mother fell sick - and then that my mother, &amp;c. it should have been, had you had a proper regard for your mother-tongue.</p>
            <p>Ibid. l. 19, - I slept over - what taken napping again!</p>
            <p>Page 86, l. 7, - he must be mined - I said ruined, which is at least clearer sense than yours.</p>
            <p>Page 106, l. 5, - if Phormis durst not - a gross misnomer - The gentleman's name was Phormio.</p>

            <p>Page 159, l. 18, - notion of general life - So far is genteel life from being general, that here, Sir, you are particularly mistaken.</p>
            <p>These, Mr. Printer, are your principal errors; and as there are some few capital mistakes among them, they are, by order of the court, to be sent to the house of correction.</p>
            <p>Turn back to volume the first, page 58, l. 8, and then tell me - whether a dumb man can say Bo to a goose? - This query I leave to be resolved by any naturalist of the r-y-l society, or by the authors of the Ladies' Diary.</p>

            <p>Query 3d. Whether it would not be an excellent clause in the G-me-act, that should forbid any m-mb-r's shooting, or hunting during the session of p-r-l--m-nt?</p>
            <p>Query 4th. If a gentleman loses 10,000l. at a horse-race, is this to be considered as an argument of his avarice, or of his prodigality?</p>
            <p>Query 5th. Is not this an odd conclusion of a book?</p>
