            <pb n="ii" xml:id="pb-ii" facs="#i10"/>
             <p>to enlarge upon. What a diversity of lights, all resplendent with the most engaging charms, all truly characteristical of the accomplished MAN, has not your LORDSHIP appeared in? The Patriot, the Statesman, the Philosopher, the Orator, the Poet, all united and perfected in your Person, afford us an illustrious specimen of the force of nature, when nurtured and cultivated in her proper foil. But these bright qualities are not the only that reflect dignity on your LORDSHIP: A thousand others, though not so commonly magnified by the applause of mankind, command our esteem. What shall I say of your Virtues in social life? Your friendly and humane disposition has at all times attracted hearts; not in the spirit of adulation, but with the warmth of</p>
            <pb n="iii" xml:id="pb-iii" facs="#i11"/>
             <p>sinceriry. Good wishes, and frequently realized by their effects, for promoting the cause of Letters, have brought over the whole tribe of Authors to your side. They justly celebrate you as the only MAECENAS of the Age, and repute it a more than adequate reward of the pains they have taken, to be honoured with the patronage of the EARL of CHESTERFIELD; a patronage fully sufficient to bring into request their productions. How happy would they be, could they lay in a permanent claim to it: But, alas! the ravages of time on the human frail vessel, abridge the prospect of such fine hopes: And, what is equally discomforting to them, they despond with good reason that when the GOLD BRANCH is cropt, a succeeding Shoot will not be able to display</p>

I.</p> <p>WELL fare the scattered brains of Tristram Shandy, Gent. who, for aught I know, is the first, that neither behind backs, nor in a chimney corner, nor in a whisper; but point blank, before your face, above board, and in printed words,</p>

             <p>his favourite * * * *, the only delectable constellation in his heaven, excites him to make on them the most accurate astronomical observations.</p> <p>There's a period for you, friend Tristram! It is as round, and as plump, and as well jumbled together, as any you have yet hit upon. What a rare thing it is to be wise? Yes, - a very rare thing, if you bear away the bell, and I am unknown: I! - who am intrinsically as merry a blade as you: - mark the word intrinsically; you will somewhere in this work find a reason for it: - I! - who am as scientific: - you will find, that I will not bate you an ace, if not exceed you in learning: - I! - who am as expert an architect as you: - You will behold with admiration what a brilliant superstructure I shall raise on the strength of my imagination: in short, I! - who am as nice a cook of thoughts as you: - lick your lips; you may now, if you will, in the spirit of</p>
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>expectation, taste the delicious repast; the table will be covered with variety; and if you can delight in sauces to your meat, of purely domestic and native qualities, untinctured, unsophisticated by the elements of exotic haut goÃ»ts, they shall be at your service.</p> <p>What say you; and is it true, that the constituent corpuscules of your brains are wind and water? It may be so; - I shall not puzzle my own poor brains by painful researches into the cause of so strange an accident. I call it so, because not being a phenomenon of real nature, it can at best, be but one of her sports; just as I have once seen in a Moco-stone, the head of a leering sly fox, like you in a frontispiece to your cousin Yorick's sermons, peeping out of his den. If it then exceeds all the intellectual faculties I ever was, or ever shall be master of, to investigate and assign the cause why you, as an exception to the rest of the</p>
            <pb n="5" xml:id="pb-5" facs="#i17"/>
             <p>human species, have your brains brimfull of wind and water, can you blame me for so humble a confession of my inabilities? - But, harkee! I will deal fairly, and tell you, what I judge to be the effects in a more explicit manner, of this wind and water, at least of the wind. - First, you know that by the name of wind, almost all philosophers understand a sensible motion or flux of the air. If this motion be somewhat impetuous, or the current of the air rapid, it is properly wind: if the commotion be but slight, it is then a breeze, a gale, a gentle puff, and not wind. Secondly, you know what water is; its properties, qualities, and every thing belonging to it; therefore I shall spare myself the trouble of defining it.</p> <p>Now, what deductions can we make from the premisses? Let us suppose that your animal spirits - I shall use my best endeavours, in the course of this work,</p>
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>to oblige the inquisitive part of mankind with a very elaborate dissertation on the origin, nature, operations, effects, and - I don't know myself yet - with how many anecdotes of the animal spirits. - Hang it; this long-winded parenthesis has broke too violently the thread of my discourse: how the critics will maul me for it! - Well then, I say, let us suppose that your animal spirits, being agitated themselves by some cause best known to yourself, are the impelling cause of the wind and water of your brains. When the impulsion operates with violence, and in a degree of velocity peculiar to wild fire, then the wind is wind indeed; it is an exhalation mixed with vapour; it madly scouts out of your head wherever it can find a vent, or, as an ancient translator of Virgil expresses it in English hexameters:</p> <p>Rush do the winds forward thro' per'ct chinck narrolie whizling,</p> <p>Tristram turmoyling with blast and teribil buzzing.</p>
            <pb n="7" xml:id="pb-7" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>In what disposition of mind and body must I conceive you to be then in? No other, I am certain, than that of being able to form a digression. Your elbows begin immediately to want cobler's room; the friend, that happens to sit or stand near you, is well off, if he escapes with the dashing out of a few teeth; and your own skull may felicitate its preservation from a fracture, if its situation is not within reach of a rencounter with some hard substance.</p> <p>If your body cannot help, nor be restrained from expanding and dilating itself; how prodigious on this emergency must the evagations of your mental faculties be? - Here will I hold, and will not go one jot farther till I weigh in a very nice pair of scales the benefits arising from this digressive appetite.</p> <p>It is notorious that doctor Swift interspersed his Tale of a Tub with digressions,</p>

             <p>and that he even wrote a digression in praise of digressions. It is certain the drama would lose the high relished flavour it ought to have; would not captivate our minds by an enchantment we cannot guard against; would not be sufficiently picturesque of what passes in life, were it destitute of those incidents, those contrivances, those scenes of business, which, though they might seem to perplex the action and narrative; yet, in effect, heighten their graces with a more strong, lively and lasting colouring. the characteristic of genius is a composition expressive of its nicest and boldest strokes; but if it dares not go our of the bounds of a beaten course; if it keeps an equal pace from the beginning to the end; if fancy, its moving spring, is spiritless, and so daunted, that it will not make a sally to extricate itself itself from a little embarassment; how will it gain admirers, or is it possible that it should? Pass in diligent review the face of nature: you see how</p>

             <p>studious she has been to diversify her features: in this diversity are her most engaging charms: from land she has made transitions to water, and in both how many divisions and subdivisions, all different in themselves, and all pleasing by being different! Here are rugged mountains, there smooth vallies; here are woods and forests, there pasture and arable grounds; here is a mighty expanse of water, a sea, an ocean; there water gushes out of the bowels of the earth: it is a cool pellucid spring; it creeps through the grass, it swells into a rivulet, a brook, and nimbly skips over pebbles of its own polishing; anon, uniting with other streams, it prides itself in assuming the majestic flow of a river. in short, throughout all the works of nature and art, nothing but variety has the power of amusing; so that every thing passing through the organs of the senses, must divest itself as much as possible of a uniform appearance, must make frequent digressions</p>

             <p>from what it is to what it may be, and by striking in with the oddities of successive new modes, seem comet like, blazing and wonderful in a course of eccentricities.</p> <p>How well I am pleased, master Tristram, with the broad hints you have given me for making out this common place with so much precision, besides embellishing it with so much finery! but give me leave to digress from you in opinion, even according to the same measure you have digressed from the manner of writing authenticated by the best masters. Swift you say, is exceeding digressive, and you point to his elogium of digression, to shew how fond he was of going awry. For my part, I have been acquainted with the gentleman for some years, and always thought he walked straight and upright; I never knew him, as you, to have either a cold or hot fit of the ague; his air manifested no redundancy of peccant</p>

             <p>humours, so as to call in a pair of crutches to consolidate his supporters in arthritic claudication; I never heard him cough so hard, as that his physician could prognosticate his pulmonic follis wanted a new nozel, though he often skaited as well as you against the wind in Flanders; if ever he made excursions from home, far from treating or being treated by his distant friends with reservedness after the fashion of strangers, they vied with each other who should exert most the familiarity of obsequiousness; if obliged to go a journey on the king's high road, though mounted on a winged Pegasus, he never flew over turnpikes, but peaceably paid his quota, according to act of parliament; if his business was not very pressing to hasten him to his journey's end, he would sometimes turn out of his road, to survey the adjustments of a charming villa, or to dine with my lord duke, in order to set to rights his notions in politics, or to pass encomiums on the politesse</p>

             <p>my lady dutchess had taught her lap-dog.</p> <p>And now I wish, Mr. Shandy, I could set you down in my books as a gentleman of some accomplishments, bearing, if not a striking, at least a sort of resemblance to those of doctor Swift. - You have conned over very probably his ani-adversions "on the words Brother Protestants and Brother Christians;" but I would not have you, for all the world, imagine, that you are any way allied, either in affinity or consanguinity, to so creditable a brotherhood. No, good sir, you are not. - If any fatality awaits you, it is all owing to your perverse and obstinate animal spirits, that will have their own way: - Hey, they go mad, you say; and the very moment you are fixing the main point of the process of fortification, propagation, obstetrication, predication, Yorick's bickerings, uncle Toby's chastity, mama's modesty, papa's potency, - </p>
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>- the wicked imps drag you by the neck and heels out of your biass, and set you agog upon making ropes of sand.</p> <p>Oh! indignity! that you should thus be traduced by them. Oh ignominy! that they should ever raise a blush in your face. yes, they will raise a blush, when you reflect upon their indiscretion in your lucid intervals. Then it is that you will rise up with all the energy of condemnation against yourself for relinquishing the chaste love of a virtuous lady to go astray after strange women. And, indeed, your itch for digression, as you manage it, argues in you as great an itch for illicit amours. It is said, you cannot in a decent place look an honest woman in the face; but you can considently range about the labyrinths of the lanes, alleys and purlues of your * * * *.</p> <p>I shall neither teize you nor myself any longer about the propriety of your digressions;</p>
            <pb n="14" xml:id="pb-14" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>but remember the advice your uncle Toby designs to give you before he he dies: "Dear Tristram, will he say, I cannot but love and thank you for the pains you have taken to induce this censorious world to think well of my chastity. You have done, my boy, as it seemed befitting the discretion of our family; and I verily believe, posterity will be persuaded that I really received the wound in my groin at the siege of Namur. Had you given them the least inkling, that I got it in storming a castle of Venus, by the springing of a mine beneath the angle of the counterscarpe, placed between two bastions of the covered way, my memory would have been perpetually cannonaded with gibes, scoffs and taunts, and no ravelin, however strongly constructed and situated, could have defended it against the bombardment of ridicule. Indeed, Tristram, you have saved, I hope, my reputation; a good name is better than riches, and, though I thank you again</p>
            <pb n="15" xml:id="pb-15" facs="#i27"/>
             <p>and again, yet, as I see you require something more substantial than thanks, let me counsel you to be aware of dissipating your animal spirits by idle digressions from what you ought to be about. Authors and critics will take out a commission of lunacy against you, both for your absence of mind, a strong argument of its insanity, and for your wanderings from the true method of writing, of which, no reverie, however pleasant and fanciful, can exculpate your non-observance. If you love variety, let it flow from the very nature of the subject you treat; and if this subject refuses to be shewn in different lights, if it cannot put on two, three, or more faces, let there be a gentle sliding to another, curiously wrought by art and almost imperceptible. Thus the principal and incidental matter will friendly conspire to produce a regular whole; otherwise it will only be a fool's coat with patches of purple and scarlet: - Sed nunc non erat his locus. - <note>Latin</note></p>
            <pb n="16" xml:id="pb-16" facs="#i28"/>
             <p>There's a great deal in this seasonable inuendo of Horace. - Profitez en mon cher Tristram!"</p> <p>I shall make no addition to this cordial piece of advice uncle Toby intends to bequeath you as his best legacy, but only wish you was quite sensible of its value. At present, in expectation of being some time hence of more signal service, I recommend you to the care of doctor Slop: he will extract the ventose and aqueous inhabitants of your cerebrum and cerebellum, and substitute in their room Homunculi of whatever dimensions you desire him. In the whole, I applaud your ingenuity, and above all, your prefixing no contents to your chapters. In this, following your laudable example, I shall gladly consign over to the critics the trouble of mustering together these summaries for the benefit of their own readers. No branch of literature, in my opinion, is so essential to them, as a profound knowledge in</p> 
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i29"/>
             <p>the recapitulatory art; and this my opinion seems corroborated by the mechanical turn of genius, the sagicious editors and proprietors of the Reviews require in their Reviewers, for manufacturing an analysis. If they are deficient in all other qualifications for criticism, they think it of no moment towards retarding the advancement of letters.</p> <note>image - decorative chapter break</note> <p>CHAP. II.</p> <p>SOME gave Historians, older, I dare say, than my great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, have told us a very odd story, - aye, and averred it for matter of fact, - concerning Pallas, as how she was born into the</p>
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i30"/>
             <p>world out of Jupiter's brains. - This Jupiter must have been a very queer fellow to think even of constructing a generative repository in his skull; but it may be questioned whether he actually did, or could do so: for if he did, we may naturally suppose, that during the alst month of his pregnancy, his head exceeded the dimensions of a beer-butt, - - - what a strange figure he must have then made! - and that when his parturient mouvements raised a corrugation in his nose, and contracted his eye-brows with fretfulness, his skull fairly cracked, nay burst asunder, to give emissions to a birth so well grown and so promising as Pallas.</p> <p>it could not be otherwise; and this I prove by incontestable argument.</p> <p>Whatever way conception was performed, by what genial powers, or by what co-operation of active and passive</p>
            <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i31"/>
            <p>principles, it little concerns us to know. Jupiter according to the faith of story conceived the embryo of Pallas in his head; as she lay couched in his pineal gland, she absorbed her first alimentary juices from that refined, subtil fluid, which has its source in that part, and thence branching into several almost imperceptible rivulets, permeates the ducts of the visual, olfactory, auditory, gustative and tactive nerves; when she grew biggish, requiring no doubt, more substantial food, she consumed by degrees the whole and intire mass of his brains; and at last, having eaten away to the bare bones of his skull, not leaving a * hard or soft membrane standing, and being no longer able to subsist where she was, she made a forcible eruption in the perfect state and size of a heroine, with</p> <note>footnote</note> <p> * Two membranes that enwrap the brain, the inner of them soft, the other hard.</p>             
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i32"/>
            <p>sword in hand, and armed cap-a-pee. Now Jupiter could not help on this occasion having his skull fractured in a miserable manner; nay, more than fractured, as a hole must have been made big enough for one to creep out at by the head and shoulders. What surgeon undertook to cure the affected part; how he performed the operation; how soon after Jupiter recovered; what process was instituted for refunding him his brains; or what seminal matter capable of vegetating anew into that substance so essential to the well0being of intellectual faculties, was infused into his skull; are circumstances, all and every one of which, the sagacity of the Historiographers of this event, has so much left us in the dark about, that to hazard a few rational conjectures on the subject, would even puzzle the brains of the inquisitive Doctor H**.</p>
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i33"/>
            <p>On this occasion, I must think that those formal wights, who take the dimensions of every thing according to the letter, and would fain persuade others as well as themselves that there is no plus ultra, are blessed with both Asinine skulls and Asinine brains, which will appear such upon dissection. They will give me leave, and if they do not, I will take leave, to run counter to their opinion, and to assert boldly, that Jupiter's parturition was entirely mysterious, or to speak more modishly, allegorical, typical, symbolical, hieroglyphical, or any other way, that my be expressive of what it was not after the common manner. The wise Athenians in making choice of Pallas for their patroness, called her both * Polemica nad Politica, Warlike and Civil; thereby denoting that the good constitution of a commonwealth depends of the</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Plutarch in Phocione &amp; Pelopida.</p>
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i34"/>
            <p>conspiring energy of military and civil discipline; for, though a commonwealth ought to be formed rather for peace than war, yet its stability and duration require that it should be so ordered as to stand by both.</p> <p>We now find that mysterious science refuses with good reason to be unveiled to vulgar eyes. They may stare and wonder how the thing is so, as they are taught to believe; but the Illuminati alone can explain to you, that Jupiter as a wise legislator had projected and put in execution the best form of government; that Pallas, the Foetus, before she issued from his head, was the mature deliberation he had taken, in exactly weighing and adjusting the merits of his scheme; and that Pallas, the Adult, when she issued from his head, was the due and prudent administration of the same scheme of government, whereby it was connected</p>
            <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i35"/>
            <p>and preserved in the accurate proportion of full vigour.</p> <p>As one that can lay in a just claim to be ranked among those Illuminati, I shall venture to say, that Jupiter was also, what you may call, a good author. He never, as I could hear, set pen to paper without a regular concoction and perfect digestion of profound thought; he kept in constant rumination all the sides of a question, and it was therefore he never betrayed any symptoms of crudities; in short, tho' by his meditabund attitudes he was often hooted at as crack-brained, yet the emanations of these his brains, were always found well consolidated, nervous and durable.</p> <p>I frequently wished, especially whenever a serious reflection, which was but very seldom, mingled with my thoughts, that I could have prevailed on myself in</p>
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i36"/>
            <p>the shape and manner of an Author, to resemble Jupiter. But, alas! the volatility of my genius could never be fixed: I struggled hard to do it, but found it impracticable. never could I pre-meditate two minutes: never could I lay a scheme or plan; so that when I sit down to write, I scarce ever know what my subject-matter will be, till it starts up all of a sudden. Then indeed, lest it should play arch tricks with me, as Proteus was wont to do, when like one of our lawyers he did not chuse to resolve a question without a handsome fee, I bind it up tight and fast, and never let it go, till I discuss and excuss it as I list.</p> <p>And, now I pray all critics existing and possible, since I have let them into the secret of my genius and humour, to muster up all the animadversions they are capable of, on the Life and Opinions I am going to write. I no more know myself</p>
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i37"/>
            <p>yet than the man of the Moon, what sort of Life, and what sort of Opinions they are likely to turn out: but supposing, (to avoid the imputation of self-sufficiency,) that they will deserve something more than a supercilious treatment from the critics, I think it proper to give them here notice, that the moment they read this paragraph, they may judge themselves, by my special permission, authorized and privileged, to prepare their arms, ordinary and extraordinary, for exterminating them, if they have power to effect it; as for their good will, I make no doubt of it. - Critics are said to be well furnished with fangs, tusks, claws, talons, hooks, crooks, and all the implements that can be imagined for biting and scratching. - let them with all my heart bite and scratch what I write, provided they do not bite and scratch me in propriÃ¢ personÃ¢; <note>Latin</note> if they do, like the viper in the fable, they may find my * File of well-tempered</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* . . . . . .

I humbly conceive a more rational, and withal a more compendious process of criticism, could not be instituted by them. Besides saving time, a great deal of which must be wasted in hammering out a few dull remarks on the dulness or inanity of a book, all the compilers of the several Reviews, all the dabblers in criticism of some magazines and public papers, all the Printers, Booksellers, Editors and others, concerned in promoting the cause, and vending the effects of criticism, may assemble on a short warning, and after pledging one another in gin or two-penny, walk in procession with the pillory on their heads, till they can decently fix it, suppose at Fleet-Ditch, with the book, the dismal object of their hatred, suspended</p>

III.</p> <p>THERE is a rule in writing, which, the greatest part of those, who call themselves Authors, trespass against; and this is, either beginning too high up, or if they do set out in the proper place, immediately making excursions by silly circumlocution or idle apology. I shall make no apology for what I write: some may like it, and some may not; - and if the critics accuse me of beginning where I ought not; if they also accuse me of being deficient in the true oeconomy of a discourse, of not always consulting the exactness of decorum, let them blame the time I write in, and the age I</p>

            <note>image - decorative chapter break</note> <p>CHAP. IV.</p> <p>MY Father's family name was Montfichet, not Mountfidget as some were often pleased to spell and pronounce it; for I never could learn that any of the family were troubled with the Fidgets; they were all a staid, sober, sedate set of people, both men and women; and I verily believe that it was by reason of the gravity so inherent to the family, and for which they were so remarkable, that they got the name of Montfichet, which is properly interpreted a fixed mountain, stable, immoveable, or, if you please, founded upon a rock.</p>
            <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i44"/>
            <p>But this is not what I would be at. My father, it seems, as the matter stands upon record in the waste leaves of a great bible, which has been in the possession of our family ever since the reign of king James I. having married into the Montjoy family, had nothing by his wife Bertha, my mother, but wenches, during the three first years of wedlock. - Let me see, she brought him two at her first lying-in; one at the second, and two again at the third: they all lived and thrived, grew up into bouncing lasses, and enjoy good health and spirits to this day.</p> <p>My mother had but just lain-in of her two last daughters, that is, the midwife, assisted by my grandmother Joan, my father's mother, and by my aunt Dinah, my mother's sister, had scarce set things to rights, and dressed the children, when my father entering to pay his respects to the woman in the straw, and to ask what God had sent, was briskly answered by the</p>
            <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i45"/>
            <p>midwife, "two as pretty creatures as ever eyes beheld: good lack! what sweet souls they are." "What are they, what are they, (said my father) boys or girls? Hereupon the midwife producing one, and my aunt Dinah the other, but without speaking a word about the sex: enough, enough, (said my father) I see by their caps what they are." Then turning upon his heel, he went out of the chamber, but coming back quickly and directing his discourse to my mother: "Is it not strange, my dear, that you should thus pester and incumber me with wenches? How shall I be able to portion them off; and what is worse, if you go on at this rate, I shall never have a son to perpetuate the name and good qualities of our honourable family? You are sensible of the condition my brother Dick is in; he will never marry; and so the short and the long of it must be, that the Montfichet family will see itself extinct, without any heirs male, I dont mean to its estate, which</p>
            <pb n="34" xml:id="pb-34" facs="#i46"/>
            <p>is but trifling; to its virtues, I mean, a matter of mighty consequence to those who are desirous to propagate a race of good men, for making this preverse world better than it is."</p> <p>That the reader may not surmise any thing to the prejudice of my uncle Dick, from the oblique hint my father had inconsiderately given of his inability to engage in the state of matrimony, be it known that the condition he was in, was nothing more than a rupture in his scrotum, judged by some surgeons to be incurable. He contracted it when very young, but by what accident, neither himself nor any of the family remember.</p> <p>My father spoke with so much earnestness, and so fast, that the good woman in the straw could not find room to wedge in a word, tho' she strained hard with many a significant motion to do it, notwithstanding her situation, which required</p>
            <pb n="35" xml:id="pb-35" facs="#i47"/>
            <p>great composure. It was very wrong to ruffle her temper at that time; but how should my father govern his, when children came against his will? - His little spurt of vexation now over, my mother did not fail to give vent to hers. "Lord Mr. Montfichet, (replied she) what an odd man you are! I bring you nought but girls! nay, I must bring what you yourself get. I should like boys as well as you; get them in the name of wonder: what comes, will be your own work, all your own gettings; none else, I am sure, will have a share in getting them." - "You argue the case, my dear, (said my father) as if I was suspicious that come cuckow had purloined my nest of its genuine eggs; no, no, the purity of your heart keeps it in greater security than a hundred eyed Argues set to watch it. - But is there not, (added he) turning to the midwife, some art, some method, some what-d'ye'call-it, of getting a boy rather than a girl." - "I know of none, (answered</p>
            <pb n="36" xml:id="pb-36" facs="#i48"/>
            <p>the midwife) I believe t is all as God pleases." - "Pish! woman, (said my father) God pleases nothing about it: - God has established certain general laws in nature, whereby he has destined us to act. By the law for generation, we get children, both male and female; but there is a certain animal oeconomy, a certain loco-motive power that operates, to produce either sex. If we understood well this oeconomy, and could direct exactly this power, our bodies being also properly disposed; I make no doubt of our hitting the point always, in getting, as best suited our inclinations and circumstances, either males or females. - But what am I about? - I forget myself. - I am throwing away good philosophy on a parcel of ignorant women, who know no more than the post, a tittle of what I have said. - Well, if it be possible to have a boy, I will have one. - Let me see. - (continued he) after knitting his brows and wrinkling his nose into a minute of brown study.</p>
            <pb n="37" xml:id="pb-37" facs="#i49"/>
            <p> - Aye, 'tis all right; there is an eminent physician in our neighbourhood, a very skilful anatomist, I am told; and if it be so, I am sure, he knows to a hair's breadth the animal oeconomy. Him I will advise with, cost me what it will. Besides, I will seek out for two others, equally celebrated for their profound learning: we shall have a consultation, wife; yes, a consultation of physicians! They will put us in the wya of getting boys for the honour of the Montfichet family. - What say you; I believe twenty guineas a piece will do their business; it will be no unacceptable present for only hearing them chat, and con over the matter for a few hours. - I will also have the consultation conducted in a grand and solemn manner: the doctors shall appear in all the Insignia of their scientific qualifications: Gowns, with long sweeping tails, octogonal bonnets, perriwigs floating to their girdles, ruffs overshadowing their shoulders, and their feet shod with buskins, will</p>
            <pb n="38" xml:id="pb-38" facs="#i50"/>
            <p>give a sanction to their deliberations. From such a mein and such a garb, what torrents of arts and sciences shall we not see flow to fertilize our dull conceptions? - Harkee, wife; remember nothing is to be done entre nous, till I am initiated in the method of male-propagation by these worthy doctors."</p> <p>"Upon my word, Mr. Montfichet, (said my mother) I had vast patience to hear out your tedious harangue. One less acquainted with your whims and fancies than I am, would take you to be beside yourself. - Prithee, let me have no more of your philosophy, and doctors, and animal oeconomy. I want to be at rest; I must not be disturbed; you can't think how much I am disordered by the clatter you have made, with your scheme of boy-getting: a hundred to one after all your consultations, but you may be as far to seek as ever."</p>
            <pb n="39" xml:id="pb-39" facs="#i51"/>
            <p>My mother's remonstrance was very rational, and my father, who loved her tenderly, fearing to chagreen her, quitted the chamber, desiring her to chear up her spirits, and enjoy all the quiet and comforts she could wish for.</p> <p>So soon as the midwife perceived he was gone, for near half a minute she threw herself back in the chair she sat on, expressing her surprize with up-lifted hands and eyes. Then addressing my mother, "Dear madam (said she) I can not believe that Mr. Montfichet thinks of having a consultation of physicians: no man in his senses would think of any such thing: surely, getting a boy or girl, is all as God pleases." "One should think so (cried my aunt Dinah) but his philosophy thinks otherwise." "I warrant he will have his way (said my mother) there is no persuading him off of a thing, once he has taken it in his head; I should know him by this time of day." "Aye</p>

            <p>perhaps with similes and examples; recollections, when the memory became refreshed with new and interesting anecdotes; replies, when there was a necessity of setting to rights what in some measure had been said amiss; contradictions, when every one would have the thing their own way; altercations, when they had a fair wrangle about it: To which may be added, notes of admiration, one hundred; notes of exclamation, fifty; notes of laughing, twenty-five; notes of weeping, twelve and a half; notes of grinning, six and a half; notes of pity, three and a half; notes of seririousness, one and a half: All these orations and perorations, I say, made more emphatic by their interjective elocutions, were declaimed and bandied about by this junto of female sophs, on my poor father's project for getting a boy; and they did not cease with a full period, till the squaling of the two little wenches called aloud for their attention to pacify</p>

V.</p> <p>ALL this descanting at my father's expence, and what is worse, by some of his bosom friends and nearest relations, must fill a cool reader's head (I mean the head of him who cares not a fig about the honour of the Montfichet family) with long and broad ideas, that my father was wrong-headed in all the measures he had concerted, and would be more especially int hat for male-productions, which chance-medley, or a lucky hit, might bring to a bearing; but no art or method, or any fixed plan to operate</p>

            <p>by. To exculpate my father from the odious imputation of wrong-headism, his memory may hereby be sullied with, i find it incumbent on me not to be silent as to his genuine character: Then it is, and then only, that the Judicious will know, whether they ought to commend him for his justness of thought, or make slight of him for endeavouring, or wishing to realize, what as to existence, may be deemed purely chymerical.</p> <p>My father was, what you may call, a full and notable exception, to all the general rules of common notions that prevail in the world. Whether he became thus exceptionable by the inherent force of nature, or that he made himself so by acquired habits, I could never justly learn. Very probably his humour for segregating himself from the opinions that reign in the world, was worked up to a due consistency from a well digested meditation of Descartes' philosophical principles.</p>
            <pb n="44" xml:id="pb-44" facs="#i56"/>
            <p>He was often heard to say, that the first part of a man's life should be contemplative; that is, as soon as reason could emerge from the prejudices of infancy and education, and be able to judge of the fitness of things, man ought frequently and attentively to consider what he is, and for what end he was sent into the world. Under the guidance of these two principles, man may be thoroughly acquainted with the different relations of his conduct to the author of his being, to himself, and to his neighbour. If the sallies of youth, or the fumes of passion should throw a cloud over these principles, so as to obstruct or obscure the sight of them, the consequences of those inconveniencies human nature is subject to, will not be durable: habitual self-reflection will soon discuss the cloud, and reason will resume its former empire. So true it is, that what is early implanted in minds, which generally of themselves are indifferent to good and bad, will take</p>
            <pb n="45" xml:id="pb-45" facs="#i57"/>
            <p>deep root, and will be predominant throughout the whole course of life.</p> <p>To form, therefore, the moral character (as my father was wont to tell me, and the rest of his children) ought to be our first and most important concern; and, when once formed with propriety, it will not fail to be expressive of the whole dignity of man. Hence, as from a fruitful source will flow that tendency to perfection, which will give a just value to all our thoughts, words, and actions.</p> <p>To think well, because we shall speak and act accordingly, said he, (for the reader may be assured that this is all his own discourse, and not one word of mine) we may be persuaded, that nothing is better calculated for that purpose than the method of doubting proposed by the philosopher Descartes. Doubt is only</p>
            <pb n="46" xml:id="pb-46" facs="#i58"/>
            <p>a suspension of the assent in thinking; not that we can, or ought effectually to doubt of the evidence of some things; but we may well decline the determination of our judgment, till we perceive clearly if we can join or separate the ideas of what may essentially, or not, belong to them. Thus it was, that this great philosopher, exploding all the occult qualities of his predecessors, and rejecting all the opinions that could not stand the test of his methodical doubt, endeavoured to sound the abyss of nature, and by diligently exploring all parts of it, drew forth and laced things in their own light; some conspicuous by their evidence, others not less evident, tho' inscrutable by the senses; others grounded on reason and experience, and others immersed within the Arcana of nature, yet probable, as sometimes discoverable, with their particular causes and reasons, by accident, and sometimes by the sagacity of man.</p>

            <p>If we ever suffer ourselves to be led aside by error, our mishap generally proceeds form no other cause, than precipitately judging that the thing is so, before we have any distinct or clear knowledge of it. The prejudices of infancy and education, administer also a strong and lasting fuel to our rash judgments; they seem to be our sufficient Reason in all controverted matters; and we even blindly adhere to their dictates, shuddering at the thoughts, or hardships of a further research. In this disposition of mind, do we exercise that excellent gift of reason we have had freely given to us? No; the ordering of our lies and opinions would seem as if only actuated by a similar instinct to that of brute beasts. Let us then rise up from out of our senseless inaction, let us divest ourselves of our prejudices, let us sequester ourselves from the multitude, and let us boldly doubt of all things we are allowed to doubt of.</p>

            <p>Of matters of faith we have no occasion to doubt, having a very sufficient seal of their authenticity in the authority of a God, who is infinitely good and true, and therefore neither can, nor will lead us into error. If some doubt of the Being of this infinitely good and true God, let them look to themselves, to the administration of this world, and they will every where find marks of an infinite wisdom and providence. By this only consideration, the Atheist's doubts will vanish; and the Deist, by attending to the infinite goodness of God, in making known to man the way he should walk in, will not question his veracity; neither can he reason philosophically, unless he becomes a Christian. the essence of faith remains pure, unblemished and unhurt, amidst the variety of modes it may be dressed up with. The wise man may abstract his mind from whatever he finds amiss in them; he may consider them as conditions of human discipline, good</p>

            <p>perhaps in their primitive institution, but abused by the depravity of hearts bent upon gain; and in this point of view he must repute it an absurdity, to think in common, that there is a diversity of Christian religions subsisting in the world. There is but one Christian religion, like a stout oak tree, firmly rooted, and from a robust trunk expanding itself into several branches. Some of the branches of this one religion, may decay and finally perish, because they refused the nourishing sap of the essence of faith, and swerved from the moral rectitude of the gospel, in which all the precepts we see laid down and inculcated, contain nothing more than the laws of nature recommended and enforced in the state of perfection. An absolute, or implicit belief of matters purely speculative, and for which we can find no satisfactory warrants in Revelation, or the force of Reason, is not required of us by God; but he requires of us the belief and practice</p>
            <pb n="50" xml:id="pb-50" facs="#i62"/>
            <p>of the positive truths in his gospel, on which he will judge us. Hence, we must condemn all penal laws, inquisitions, or any other sort of persecution, compulsive of men's consciences to the belief of speculations, frivolous in their own nature, and absurd in practice. Every man, provided he is just and honest, no enthusiast, no incendiary, no disturber of the public peace, should be peaceably permitted to indulge his private sentiments; they are innocent in themselves, and neither can do himself nor others any harm. But there will be always contrivances of wicked and selfish men for forcing the impenetrable intrenchments of conscience, whilst there is such a thing in a state, as the governing Powers are pleased to call the Established Religion. Certain it is, that political prudence finds the union of religious opinions very necessary for the support of absolute and arbitrary monarchies, but the same cannot be said of a free state. So soon as it is declared,</p>
            <pb n="51" xml:id="pb-51" facs="#i63"/>
            <p>that the subject shall enjoy liberty and property in their temporals, the same also ought to be understood of their spirituals, supposing always that the laws proposed for their regulation admit nothing contrary to moral rectitude. Some subjects of the free state dissent from its established religion; education, conscience, or reason, dissuades them from complying with its forms and manner of worship; their tenets or opinions, are no way repugnant to the morality of the gospel: ought they therefore to be excluded the immunities and privileges those only of the established religion are entitled to, or must they, to qualify themselves in order to partake of them, abjure and recant, according to the ceremonial of whimsical oaths, tests, and other embryos of fancy? It seems that a state, priding itself in being free, should not lay some of its subjects, equally good with the rest, under such restraints. A civil toleration may be granted: - suppose it is, yet it will not</p>
            <pb n="52" xml:id="pb-52" facs="#i64"/>
            <p>answer the ends proposed by the enjoyment of a well regulated liberty and property. All good subjects in general, without examining into their religious principles, for which they are accountable to God alone, ought to have an unquestionable right to the benefits of the free state they live under, and are governed by; otherwise, the state cannot be said to be free; it is so only in part, and not in the whole. Real and undisputed merit, wherever found, should challenge notice, and even adequate rewards; but a phantom of established religion, the greatest incongruity in a free state, keeps it groveling at a distance, depressed by the ignominy of sordid repulses.</p> <p>let it be remembered, that it is next to an impossibility to destroy any one particular religion, when it has once taken root. Extravagant flights may start up, but they will soon fall; like a delirious fever that raises an active spring of uncommon</p>

            <p>strength, in a body otherwise quite debilitated by its ailment, but is of no continuance, death, or a renovation of health, soon after succeeding. Vice and immorality, sometimes the immediate consequence of pernicious doctrines, may have their day of triumph; but the indignant emotions of virtue, the love of order, will quickly bring them to shame and confusion. So that the permanency of any religious sect must be grounded on the purity of its doctrines; and if it is reducible to this standard, if it can stand this test, it cannot be set aside, and ought of consequence to meet with no oppression.</p> <p>It were to be wished, that all men could be induced to think alike, especially in religious matters, but unfortunately they cannot: liberty of thought must have its prerogatives. The body may be compelled to stood under the yoke of base servitude; the apprehension</p>
            <pb n="54" xml:id="pb-54" facs="#i66"/>
            <p>of pain, the fierceness of tyranny, may over-awe it to extort the mind's compliance: but the mind within itself stands erect, and smiles at all the impotent efforts for subduing it. Sometimes even it will not listen to the complaints of the body, and boldly commanding it to suffer, says plainly it cannot retract. Tertullian observes, that the blood of martyrs was the feed of Christians. His remark was just: for the blind rage of one religious party to extinguish another of a different opinion, serves only to animate this other, both to ward off the blow, and to propagate itself with greater zeal. Of this we have many dismal examples among Christians, which none but the sober thinking and the wise know how to lament, and wish that such again may never happen to disturb the good order of the world.</p> <p>If the sentiments of all men in regard to religion cannot be made to square with each</p>

            <p>other, so neither will their sentiments in politics. Both are influenced by the same spirit, as to the freedom of thought, and often the one is the result of the other. The former naturally rejecting a coalition of parties, may, notwithstanding, by a suitable degree of civil toleration, become serviceable to a state, and conspire friendly to promote its welfare. the liberty and property of the subject are sufficient for the acquiescence of the latter, so as to be a bar against the evils of anarchy and confusion, and to excite an universal desire of contributing to the common good.</p> <p>However, politics will never arrive at perfection in practice, chiefly by reason of the changes commonwealths are subject to. Some commonwealths have been thought founded on the most wholesome laws, and secured by the best regulations; yet, on several accounts, have made trial of the fatality of vicissitude. The different</p>
            <pb n="56" xml:id="pb-56" facs="#i68"/>
            <p>state of men and times, may perhaps make such changes necessary; so that, as no stability in politics can be expected, we have it only in our power to delineate a fine picture of political perfection, which we may contemplate for the recreation of our minds, whenever the system of what we permit ourselves to be governed by, displeases us, either by the grossness of its machinery, or the unskilfulness or baseness of its directors.</p> <p>Absolute and uncontrolled monarchy would be the best form of government, if an angel from heaven was to be the monarch, who, by the condition of his nature, could furnish no exceptions against his conduct. But since a man must be the monarch, a man perhaps addicted to ambition, avarice, arrogance, cruelty; a slave to all the incentives of voluptuous living; a seeker of happiness for himself alone; will it be said that government in such hands is a thing desireable? Again,</p>
            <pb n="57" xml:id="pb-57" facs="#i69"/>
            <p>supposing monarchy limited, or its annexed power laid under certain restrictions; will the man, commissioned to wield the scepter, who by his actions proves himself vicious, be fit for governing? This power is thought by the subject to be so fixed, that even if ambition should prompt him to arbitrary views, he must stop short, and cannot annoy them. But who are those who administer under for him? Who are those that share the legislative power with him? Are they wise and prudent, irreproachable in their lives, of sufficient abilities to discharge the trust reposed in them? Are they disinterested? Can they remain uninfluenced by bribes? can the motives of self-preservation be more prevalent with them than those of consulting the welfare of their country? Can they be shaken from the honest purpose of their souls, in the service of this country, thro' fear of incurring the displeasure of the prince? If non of these particulars can, in the strictness</p>
            <pb n="58" xml:id="pb-58" facs="#i70"/>
            <p>of truth, be affirmed of them, but that on the contrary they are sycophants, corruptors and corrupted; measurers of the extent of their duty, by the emoluments of their places and pensions; their hearts feared with the warmest affections for venality; studiers by the spirit of self-interestedness, of the interest of the prince as separate from the interest of the subject: - - Will limited monarchy, administered by such legislators, the debauchers of the morals of their nation, be also desireable? NO; the constitution, 'tis true, is excellent in speculation, but wicked men make it execrable in practice. What can we find then more eligible than the true Republican form of government? Virtue under its auspices will have her encouragement and reward. Liberty, regulated by the prescript of order, will dread no infractors of its rights, either from the ambition of the great, or the tumultuous clamours of the populace. Power will not be guilty of indecencies, when conscious</p>

            <p> to itself of its short duration, and that it must be accountable for any abuse made of its authority. Such was the ancient Roman republic, whilst integrity sat at the helm. It conquered the world, because it had virtues to conquer it; but so soon as it became degenerate by the spirit of avarice and corruption, it ceased to be; which will be the fate of all other states equally corrupt, or at least like the crisis of a malignant fever, either promising approaching death, or a sounder constitution for life, by purging quite away, the collected mass of ill humours.</p> <p>Thus far the gentle reader may see how cautious I have been not to touch myself upon my father's cast of mind, least I should palm upon him opinions he had no great liking to. It was best to let him speak for himself; "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." These thoughts of his on religion and politics, when I was of age to comprehend</p>

            <p>them, he duly repeated over to me once a week, and in the same serious and declamatory mood I laid them down, desiring me not to forget from time to time to chew the cud of understanding upon them, as points of singular importance in life. I must confess I always entertained a very exalted idea of my father's integrity, and more especially of his extensive spirit of benevolence; for he often considered himself as a citizen of the whole world, and ardently wished that he could improve mankind in goodness. His greatest foible was his searching after things buried in the recesses of nature, or whose knowledge is too intricate for our penetration to lay open. If what be conceived implied no contradiction, if it carried a face of probability, he was eager for a discovery: not that he was positive at the same time; for he called in his check of doubting, before he set about examining. If he sometimes consulted others, it was because he presumed, that a person ought to be a</p>
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i73"/>
            <p>greater adept in what he had expressly studied, in order to profess the same, than another who only studies for private satisfaction. With this view he fancied a consultation of physicians advisable to help him in making out the process of getting a boy occasionally rather than a girl. But the reader may be surprized, and so am I how a man of his sense, should require, as he was pleased to signify to my mother, that his doctors should appear badged out, to give a greater sanction to their definitive sentences on the art of male-generation. I could find no reason assigned for this oddity in any of the memoirs he left behind him for my special perusal; so that I must beg the favour of the courteous reader to have a little patience, whilst I strive to account for it in the following chapter.</p>

VI.</p> <p>WHEN a man is persuaded, or others for him, that appearing under such a character, that professing himself this or that, would suit his interest, by putting money in his pocket, and getting him a good name; - whatever his interiour is, whether full or empty, broad or narrow, round or square, hollow or flat, it little matters, so his whole exteriour is composed to a symbolic indication of what he would have himself reputed. By thus ordering himself, he becomes in effect a sort of Egyptian hierogrammatist, with this difference only, that as the gypsey marked out his hieroglyphics, or mysterious</p>

            <p>science, on posts and pillars to be gazed at; so he marks out his own on himself, to be reconnoitred as a sign-post, or wondered at as Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt.</p> <p>Nothing in the world excites curiosity more than mystic arts and sciences. If the vulgar by the obtuseness of their parts cannot cut into them, so as to appropriate a slice to themselves; they will, if they can, be sharpened or cut by them; which is the same, as if I said, that though they are not able to dip into their operating causes, they have a great itch to be dipt by their operated effects. Nothing but experience, unless they are moon-struck, can convince them, whether the particle of knowledge they have been initiated in, will be followed with joy or regret; whether the purchase is on easy terms, or makes them smart; and whether, when all is said and done, they have not good reason to wish all hieroglyphical, symbolical</p>
            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i76"/>
            <p>emblematical, typical, problematical, aenigmatical virtuosos, with all their arts, sciences, mysteries, crafts, cunnings, and all the implements of these by the name of modes, modifications, figures, configurations, essences and quintessences, to to the devil. They have no other alternative than such a wish, unless they have a mind to wish themselves of the association for having dealt with them; for having by their means conjured up a spirit, which they will not be able to lay.</p> <p>I thought fit to premise thus much to what I am going to say, because it will be a main prop to it; but if any of our hireling critics do not understand me, let them attend to the following illustration.</p> <p>All the knowledge that can be gleaned by man's intellects in this world, is built upon mathematical demonstration, or conjecture. I need not here enumerate the several branches of mathematical learning;</p>
            <pb n="65" xml:id="pb-65" facs="#i77"/>
            <p>all are acquainted with, or at least have heard of their utility. Of conjectural learning I make three grand divisions, divinity, law, and physic. I call these sciences conjectural; because tho; they have an object positively true to consider, they vary in their interpretations concerning what may be the real truth of the object; and also sometimes disfigure the object, if not intirely falsify it by substituted sophistications, so that its truth cannot be discerned.</p> <p>The object of divinity among christians is their faith. The gospel is true; therefore there is a true faith. But the question is, where this true faith exists, according to the truth of the gospel. Divines have made its existence very precarious, by defining what is, and what is not faith. If one says it is here, another tells him he lies, and that the gospel makes it there. One might be tempted from the diversity of their decisions to believe</p>
            <pb n="66" xml:id="pb-66" facs="#i78"/>
            <p>that Christ has no visible church upon earth, tho' he has in reality; but the question will return, 'where?' Divines will not satisfy you in this point; they all lay in and fix upon the claim of their particular societies. What must a poor simple christian do, bewildered in such an irremeable labyrinth? His judgment is not so found or acute that he can judge for himself: scripture may be his rule of faith, but to understand scripture, he must abide by the determination of this or that divine, which this or that other divine declares to be erroneous, or quite foreign to the sense of scripture. Therefore all divinity is mere conjecture, and all its professors, mere conjecturers. It will be impossible for any set of divines to refute what I here advance, unless they pretend to an infallibility of doctrine, which, if they cannot clearly prove, all they have hitherto done, and will hereafter do, by dint of specious reasons and plausible argument, must go for nothing. They</p>
            <pb n="67" xml:id="pb-67" facs="#i79"/>
            <p>have been only putting themselves to their wits end for contriving ways and means to scrub and rub the blackmoor into a more familiar colour.</p> <p>The second division of conjectural learning, is the law. it has been aptly placed as a stickler between the two other divisions, to prevent any clashing in their respective interests, or with a view of putting them in mind of the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill;' or which perhaps is more probable, to serve occasionally to either as an alterative medicine: for as divinity is physic to the soul, in opposition to the physic prescribed for working the body; so law is physic to both the soul and body, working the soul by the perturbations of a peck of troubles, and the body by retrenching its superfluities: nay, often by reducing it to very low circumstances, the better to allay the ferment of its fever. - Connoisseurs understand what I here mean:</p>
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i80"/>
            <p>and now let me see, if conjecture will fit law with the same analogy it does divinity.</p> <p>Two classes of persons comprehend all that is agitated within the precincts of law. The first may be called law-givers, or makers of law; the second, law-breakers, or distributers of it in bits and scraps. The first deal in it by whole-sale, the second by retail. Suppose, the principal inhabitants of the planet of Saturn - who by the bye are noted for not caring much about a kingship among them, but just as it suits their conveniency, - should assemble to make a law for converting their lead into gold. "My lords and gentlemen! (says one of their orators, after begging their silence and attention) I humbly conceive, that the motion made for the conversion of our Saturn into the Sun, ought not in the winding up terminate barely in a conversion of silly propositions, but in a</p>
            <pb n="69" xml:id="pb-69" facs="#i81"/>
            <p>conversion of things to be of real service to us. When I was a student of logic in one of our universities, and a grace dispute arose about converting the particular proposition, "Some mouse is in the wall:" how do you think our thick-headed professor taught us to convert it? You must do it thus, said he, clapping his finger index on his nose, and staring us out of countenance, with a look of peremptory erudition: "Some wall is in the mouse." I knew immediately that he was wrong: for how the devil could the wall be in the mouse? Now, my lords and gentlemen! we shall be all wrong, and convert nothing but mice into walls, and walls into mice, if we do not previously consider of a due process for transmuting the lead we are incumbered with into gold. Sublata causÃ¢ tollitur effectus, <note>Latin</note> - which I construe thus; "Gentility without ability is like a pudding without fat;" - lets us into the secret of a bright maxim which should be attended to: it is a conditio</p>
            <pb n="70" xml:id="pb-70" facs="#i82"/>
            <p>sine quÃ¢ non, <note>Latin</note> - which I also construe thus, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it;" - Ergo, - and this I take to be a clear solution of the question."</p> <p>He spoke, was applauded, and sat him down. Up starts another orator, who, having spent a quarter of a minute and a few seconds, in dejecting the muscles of his face into melancholy symptoms, delivered himself with a wailing tone of voice in these words: "My lords and gentlemen, only see what a pickle I am in, if you can't see how you are soused yourselves over head and ears" my chin, my teeth, my ears, my nose, my skull, aye, and I believe my brains too are all lead, or incrustated with lead. Mark what heavy sheets of lead hang down from my shoulders! I must take up with them, for indeed I have no other cloths to wear.

It is true, some had hearts of stone, and were quite insensible of the pressure, however accumulated: these were they who had grains of allowance made them in gold, privately shuffled about for their secret services.

This ingenuous confession on my part shews, that Authors and Philosophers are tinctured with the spirit of avarice as well as other men, and that it is, perhaps, happy for the world the malign influence of some three-penny planet, disables them from making experiments; because, were it not for this inconveniency, they would not have been so communicative, which they are compelled to, in hopes to go snacks with an operator, who can throw away money to defray the expences of pans, pots, pipkins and crucibles. - But without any more ado, let me come to the point of conferring this great obligation on any of my readers, who may be desirous to make the most of their lead. I intreat, however, all plumbers not to meddle or make in the matter.</p>

This being done, take of the best purified and melted lead, on pound, and with an iron instrument mix it well over the fire with the fold and quick-silver: and when all are thoroughly mixed, add, with the above water, one ounce of vitriol, and after cooling, you will have some of the best sort of gold. - The lead is purified in this manner.

            <p>qualify the inhabitants of the planet of Saturn, "to convert as much of their lead as they could conveniently into gold." Now, what did all these learned speeches debates, disquisitions, deliberations tend to? To no nothing more than to establish the conjecture, that gold was better than lead. It was not to be doubted when it was once passed into a law. But how did the law-breakers, divided and subdivided into Judges, Serjeants, Barristers, Counsellors, Atorneys, Sollicitors, Clerks, Pettifoggers, behave on this Occasion? Every one of them had his own conjectures, and by conjecturing multifariously, some concerning the letter of the law, others the intention of the law-givers; some concerning the matter of right, others the matter of fact; there started up so many different states of the question, and these states gave rise to so many queries, and these queries shot up into so many disputes, and these disputes bred so many contentions, and these contentions</p>

            <p>gave vent to so much ill language, and this ill language produced so many blows; - that an honest-meaning person who imagined the law was plain enough in itself, was so puzzled and circumvented by quirks of chicanery, that he never knew when it was convenient for him to convert his lead into gold; and if he did, what quantity was necessary, with a multiplicity of clauses about the quality, or true standard for currency. - What a nice thing conjecture is, that can thus dexterously pick holes in a law! It may juggle a man out of his property; but the misfortune is, he that is juggled, cannot barely conjecture himself to be so; he finds it matter of fact.</p> <p>I shall say but little on the third division of conjectural learning, which is Physic. Those best versed in the art, will acknowledge that it all hangs upon guess-work. Diagnostics as well as prognostics have frequently made a fool of the judgment.</p>

            <p>The efficacy of certain medicines proved sometimes by experience, fails, is poisonous, brings on death, when the doctor has not guessed right at the patient's case, or ill proportions the quantity to the constitution. There are very good medicines for helping nature; but we little consider what bungling conjectures are made about their application, or who it is that dubs himself an AEsculapius. If he rolls about in a gay chariot, no doubt, the ladies of quality, who like his jogging humour, will fancy, that to cure them of the Vapours, he can at any time jog Hypocrates and Radcliffe out of his head, and Galen and Boerhaave out of his fingers ends. Alas! the poor doctor can only wish within himself that his head was as happy in conjectures, and his fingers as expert in drawing out a wholesome recipe.</p>

VII.</p> <p>I Have run too great lengths, or indeed, out of my biass in the preceding Chapter, if it can properly be called a Chapter: for a Chapter, if we mind the acceptation of the word, is nothing else than a Head, which borrows a neck for its support; and that neck a pair of shoulders and collar-bone, to connect and consolidate the back-bone that runs from it; and if both afterwards can muster up the other appurtenances of a trunk, and conclude in handsome thighs, legs and feet, or a decent tail; so much the better; the whole will be compleat, and not even a bone left</p>

            <p>for the Critics to pick. The reason of this is, that when there is a good head, trunk and limbs to a subject, there is a common tendency to preserve it entire, at least in the first and last: the head standing centinel, gives warning of the Critic's approach; the hands deal terrible blows about their Sinciputs; the feet but the finishing stroke to the chastisement, by kicking their backsides; and if there be a superaddition of a tail, when they light any where like wasps, it serves to switch them off. But the misfortune is, and it happens but too often, that a subject is proposed, and when it comes to be handled, it proves in some hands so bungled a piece of work, that you know not what to call it: You cannot discern the least scrap of head or tail to it. - Rough-handle it, cry the Critics; and well it may; so sluggish a mass must be destitute of weapons, either for defence or offence, unless it be that it cannot help offending by its deformity.</p>

            <p>Here, I perceive the reader as much nauseabund as I really am myself. He gapes a wide yawn, heaves up his nose in wrinkles, coughs and hauks, stares about him; anon drowsiness creeps upon his eyelids, and his head goes a nodding. Lo! he starts, stares, yawns and nods again. All these revolutions he has undergone both in mind and body by sympathizing with my ill humours: - the distemper is catching, and there is no Remedy for it but laughing as heartily as he can. But how shall he laugh? Can he himself display as well to the satisfaction of others as his own, the risible muscles of his visage? Has he within himself a fund of wit and humour at command to dissipate the irksomeness of this fit of oscitation? If he cannot draw his jaws into all the directions of real, I mean, unforced cachinnation; will brandy, opium or laudanum keep him from melancholy madness? No; I assure him: the conversation of some choice spirits must do</p>

            <p>spirit, a high flyer, an uncommon genius, an exquisite fancier, a self-taught philosopher, you was a tip top one. - Stand aloof ye prophane! it is not for unhallowed souls, for souls fixed on earth, time, and the fragility of human glory, that I am going to draw the outlines of my uncle Dick's character; it is for souls, which can disincumber themselves as they list, of the union with their bodies, which can mount boldly on the wings of fancy, can soar like eagles to the sun, and can enjoy their pleasures and happiness unenvyed.</p> <p>My uncle Dick, as I told the Reader in the fourth Chapter, had the misfortune, in his very early youth, of contracting a large rupture in his Scrotum, which no operation of the chirurgical art could correct. If we weigh this affair exactly, I believe we shall have no reason to repute it a misfortune; for several learned physicians, who from time to</p>
            <pb n="85" xml:id="pb-85" facs="#i97"/>
            <p>time had considered his case, were of opinion, that the spirit destined for animating the matter of procreation, not being able to get admittance into its proper ducts, on account of the obstruction which lay in its way, and which probably by a constant pressure, had broke and dislodged the texture of the parts, so as that the whole became a confused indigested bulk; - that this spirit, I say, not being able to descend, and afterwards upon occasion to find emission in the direction of a parabolical line, was foreced by a reaction on itself and the meatus's it was percolated from, to ascend and follow the direction of hyperbolical ejaculations; - so that this spirit, I say again, according to the opinion of these physicians, being impotent in regard to the begetting of children of flesh and blood, after the manner of mankind; was potent for begetting children of the brain, and all in very good condition. What these children of the brain were, I need not tell</p>

            <p>the ingenious Reader; he may easily guess at the modes and modifications of their existence.</p> <p>Now my uncle Dick, in consequence of this ailment in his Scrotum, could not with decency by breeched, as other children, who shewed in them the tokens of virility. My grandfather and grandmother, to their great regret, were obliged to keep him in petticoats, and to persuade him that he was a little girl. And indeed, he himself was so well convinced and satisfied of being of the female kind, that when any one with a malicious design of undeceiving him in his sex, called him "my pretty boy," or, "master Dicky," he would readily reply, "No, I am a pretty girl, and my mama says that I am miss Dickey, and not master," He played with dolls, and took great pleasure in building them houses, ornamenting their apartments with elegant furniture, and superintending their lyings-in</p>
            <pb n="87" xml:id="pb-87" facs="#i99"/>
            <p>and christenings till he was near thirteen. In the mean time, and till he was turned of sixteen, he learned all manner of needle-work. He was a good proficient in the science, and you would say that few of our boarding-school young ladies could excel him. Name any thing of women's craft, he could do it. He also was taught to dance; but was so awkard in courtesy-making and clean-stepping, and withal so hobbling in capering and shuffling, and cross-legging, that the dancing-master at last found himself obliged in conscience to discharge him from his care. If he was deficient in this one respect, more owing to - the gentle reader knows what, than to any want of sense in his heels, he was ingenious to a consummate degree in all the other feminine accomplishments. None could touch an instrument of music with such graceful fingers; under them every note swelled into melody; and were it his inclination to practise an organ, harpsichord, or fiddle, it</p>
            <pb n="88" xml:id="pb-88" facs="#i100"/>
            <p>would be a hard matter to find his equal; but a hankering desire to blow a blast, as he called it, upon the hautboy, or fife, or bagpipe, put all other instruments out of his head. In vain my grandmother often expostulated with him to set them aside as too boyish: for his part, he thought the music bold, and the only fit for raising the spirits.</p> <p>In short, what with hemming, sewing, felling, stitching, cross-stitching, back-stitching, quilting, carding, spinning, reeling, knitting, weaving; clear-starching, washing, ironing; brewing, baking; salting, pickling, preserving, jellying; tart-making, pye-making, custard-making, pudding-making, dumpling-making; besides an infinity of other articles too tedious to be mentioned, my uncle Dick was my grandmother's right-hand woman, executing himself in person till he was full seventeen years of age, punctually and ingeniously, all these offices, or</p>
            <pb n="89" xml:id="pb-89" facs="#i101"/>
            <p>giving directions to others for their execution. - How he suddenly left off these female practices, and by what untoward accident, you shall hear.</p> <p>It was, it seems his birth-day, he being then, as I hinted, full seventeen years of age. In order, to receive with greater decorum the congratulations of the family, and some accustomed visitants, he had dressed himself in a new gay Pet-en-l'air, an elbow hoop-petticoat, and a Paris-cap; all parts, where requisite, being illustrated with ribbon of a new pattern. He looked florid and charming; any Inamorato of the parish would be glad to receive the favour of a kiss from him. With this mien and garb, he posted away in quest of Margery, the cook-maid, to give her a memorandum of some material points in the bill of fare for dinner, which remained unsettled the night before. Margery was in her chamber, cleaning herself. She was as she</p>
            <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i102"/>
            <p>came into the world, and but just beginning to draw on a stocking, sitting upon the side of her bed, fronting the door, which was only upon the latch. My uncle Dick unceremoniously bolts in. Magery continued undaunted in the same attitude. Like, she thought, need not be ashamed to be seen by like; and indeed, she never before knew that my uncle Dick was otherwise than her like. Shall I speak out, or be silent? The object was superlatively alarming. A view, not less distinct than a microscopic view of the intima penetralia of the goddess Bona, percuffit illico animum; <note>Latin</note> that is, he saw and was confounded. The memorandums of the bill of fare were quite forgot; neither, had he remembered them, could his tongue give them utterance. Away he went, biting his nails, and dreading perhaps a more profound initiation in mysteries it was scarce safe to have only a glimpse of: however, he had reconnoitred enough to convince him that</p>
            <pb n="91" xml:id="pb-91" facs="#i103"/>
            <p>his loins had no right to be girded about with petticoats, unless it became fashionable for men to wear them, on ceding the whole property of the breeches to women.</p> <p>Coolness begets reflection, reflection fixes resolution. My uncle Dick had not sequestered himself in a closet. The hurricane in his spirits raised by the objective forms of Margery's forma informans, <note>Latin</note> was almost blown over. The passing worth of the masculine gender over that of the feminine, was stated and re-stated by him. His pretensions bade fair for the former, whilst upon examination there was nothing significative of the latter; no, not even a vestige found. But why he was made to wear petticoats, and to believe himself a female, the thought was puzzling, and wanted an ecclaircissement, which the ransacking of all his wits, could not make out. The resolution notwithstanding was taken to divest himself entirely</p>
            <pb n="92" xml:id="pb-92" facs="#i104"/>
            <p>the woman, both as to her commodes and the functions she is usually conversant in; and to put on man, not only by appearing in the apparel expressive of man, but to think and act as man.</p> <p>The question now was how to execute what he had resolved; he was not long at a loss; a suit of his brother's cloths (the same who in process of time became my father, and was only about a year and a half older) he fancied would well enough fit him for the present. Hereupon he sallied forth from his closet, composing his countenance, that he might not betray the least emotion, and went directly to his brother's chamber. Here he was disappointed; the door was locked, and upon enquiry was told, that his brother had taken a ride out and would not be at home till dinner. Any of his father's cloths were quite too large for him; yet rather than protract his desires of getting rid of his smock, hoop, Pet-en-l'air and</p>
            <pb n="93" xml:id="pb-93" facs="#i105"/>
            <p>cap, he went first to a drawer, of which he kept the keys, and took out one of his brother's shirts and cravats: next he repaired to his father's wardrobe, and made choice for his attire of a buckskin pair of breeches, a blue silk waistcoat, a scarlet cloak, a gold-laced hat, and a small sword and hanger, he found with their belts and scabbards. All these he conveyed under his petticoats to his own chamber. The door he secured by lock and bolt, and off first comes the hoop with contempt. As he was stepping out and trampling upon it, he espied his piquet, high-heeled shoes: the uppers were of blue paduasoy, laced with silver. "Oddzucks, says he, they will never do; I may as well wear no breeches as keep on these baubles; miss would be still miss, if she had a bit of miss about her." With these words the despised hoop was slipt on again. Down he went to the kitchen; not one pair of men's shoes of a tolerably moderate size to be found. How</p>
            <pb n="94" xml:id="pb-94" facs="#i106"/>
            <p>must the perplexity be got over? At last he had recollected that he had seen a pair of jack-boots hanging in the wardrobe, with huge spurs affixed to them. "That is the very thing, said he; I shall look gallant and bold like a general of cavalry." In fine, every article of the apparatus was accommodated to its proper place; the width, it is true, was ill-proportioned to a slender young gentleman, but it pleased my uncle Dick, because it made a man of him.</p> <p>Having happily completed his equipment, without the intrusion of any busy face to disconcert his measures, the pride of shewing all about the house the metamorphosis he had wrought in himself from womanhood, prompted him to come forth: Three times he unlocked and unbolted his chamber door for that purpose, three times a subrustic shame compelled him to lock and bolt it again. Shame had the ascendant, and if it was not subrustic</p>
            <pb n="95" xml:id="pb-95" facs="#i107"/>
            <p>it may well be compared to the shame described by Pliny in the peacock, which on * losing its tail; was eager to find a hiding hole. My uncle Dick, it is certain, had no great reason to regret the loss of his tail; but as use makes a bold face, he could not help looking shy to see his posteriors curtailed of it. However, at all events, he resolved not to anticipate himself the laughter of the family, but to stand patiently the brunt of it, when he could no longer prevent the discovery of the revolution in his sex.</p> <p>A long half hour elapsed, whilst by turns he stood, and sat, and walked, gazing, admiring, and musing upon his trim. It was high time to have dinner fully regulated, and Margery, as blythe as a primrose, having descended to the kitchen in her holiday geers, was in a hurry about her coquinary manoeuvres; yet could not proceed in them, for want of</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>Pudibundus, amissa causÃ¢, quaerit latebram. <note>Latin</note></p>

            <p>final instructions. Miss Dicky was sought for in all her haunts, the house resounded from top to bottom with the name of miss Dicky; no miss Dicky was found, no miss Dicky answered. "Lord bless me! (says old Mrs. Montfichet, my grandmother) what's become of the girl? How could she thus leave things at sixes and sevens? - A deal of company every moment expected, and the victuals that should be dressed for them locked up in the pantry." Whilst she still continued conferring with some of the servants what was best to be done, my grandfather entered, commanding peace, and asking the reason of all the halloboloo he had heard in the house. Margery, the cookmaid, out of breath, close followed him. "Oh lack" madam, (said she) it was God's mercy, that I had not my eye poked out. - I was up at miss Dicky's room to call her, and hearing something rustle about within, I peeped through the key-hole, and could you think it, something at</p>

            <p>first like the point of a sword was within an aim's ace of running into my eye. I saw it, as sure as you are there, stirring about. There was besides , a great slit toward the bottom of the door, and kneeling down, thinking to see better there, out comes more than half of the Sword, and before I could fall back out of its reach, - see there! what holes it has made quite through and through my apron, petticoats, - aye, faith! madam, and pricked me a little in the bottom of my belly."</p> <p>This tale of Mrs. Margery, which seemed aggravated in its circumstances by her rueful face, struck the auditory with horrour. Some conjectured this, others that, and the major part concluded that the house was haunted; - "yes, (says my grandmother, discharging a successive volley of sighs, puffs, and pants, ushered in by a wringing of her hands, and a see-sawing of her head and body before and</p>
            <pb n="98" xml:id="pb-98" facs="#i110"/>

I am ready to sink . . . . faint . . . . good God! what shall become of us?" - "What the devil of the hubbub is this? (cried my grandfather, clenching and agitating his fists, with a few alternate stamps of his feet on the floor) a mighty pother indeed, and all about what? About noon-day demons, sprights, and hobgoblins turning fencing-masters, and shewing Margery the art of pushing home flanconades. - Come all away: I'll soon unhaunt the house, I warrant yet: instead of a shadow you shall feel flesh and bones."</p> <p>These words refreshed their hearts, with a more robust way of thinking, especially after my grandmother had half composed the frightful spectre within her by a dose</p>

            <p>of good ratafia, and the rest had made pretty free with the same or some other cordial. However, as still believing or pretending a cause of terror, they sneaked after my grandfather with timid steps. Like a bold exorcist, but without the previous ceremony of fasting or prayer, he raps at Miss Dicky's door, and commands the spirit to come forth.</p> <p>The door seemed to fly open of its own accord; this was terrible! nothing stirred; more and more terrible! my grandfather entered and nothing appeared; most terrible of all! - These were the remarks on the nature and demeanour of spirits made by the women, whilst they stood at a distance knocking their knees in a cold ague-fit. - In short, my grandfather still kept bustling about the room, and looking behind the curtains; but the moment he stooped down to examine under the bed, out struts my uncle Dick from behind the door, a place not in the least suspected,</p>

            <p>and immediately falls upon the band of females with sword in hand, particularly Margery the cook-maid, whom he tilted and sweated to some purpose. The re-boation of their shrieks played so briskly upon the drum of every ear that could hear fifty yards off, that the great watch dog in the yard was set a barking. Scarce ever was noise, or racket, or hurly-burly equal to this, at least considering the number of persons; so that if you please, tho' I must still say in miniature, you may reckon it analogous to the fracas the Cyclops made in mount AEtna, when they received peremptory orders from heaven to forge two or three dozen of thunder-bolts, which sulky Jupiter designed to pelt at the heads of as many saucy ministers of state. - It may not be amiss to give here the gentle reader an idea of this clatter, which I cannot do better than in the words of an old English poet. He calls his piece, "the description of Liparen," and says it was long before his time, "expressed</p>

One would think you was ready to ride post to the carnival at Venice. Pray tell us, how came this change about?" - My uncle Dick bore with a saint-eyed patience all their curious looks and interrogatories; not one word did he reply, or motion of uneasiness did he make; and it was not till they all promised to hear him with silence and attention, that he told them of the cognizance</p>

Well then, since you must interrupt, give me leave at least to cut my story short, and to tell you in once sentence, that finding such fundamental points of difference between me and Margery, I thought proper to breech myself."</p> <p>"I can't blame you, (replied my grandfather) - I never knew a man that wished to be a woman, but I often heard women wish to be men; and I believe this is the reason why some women are so fond of contending for the prerogatives of the breeches. - Aye, now I remember the story Ovid tells us about the prophet Tiresias.

(said my grandfather) how often have I lamented your remaining in petticoats? Your mother would have it so; and women, you know, will have their way." - "It was no way of mine, (said my grandmother pertly interrupting him) you came into it, the moment I proposed it." . . . "Patience wife! one minute, (said my grandfather, waving his hand) and let me speak. - Son Dick! hear me, and mind what I say. - A rupture appeared in your scrotum, - scrotum is an anatomical term,</p>

(said my grandfather, breaking also the thread of her discourse, with a very serious air) you should tell him first what t-s are; secondly, the use nature intended them for; and thirdly, how, in a good condition, whole and entire, they are the only characteristics of virility." - </p>

I'll tutor you. - - "He must mind me, and so must you, (cried my grandfather angrily;) - - - what, am I not the man of the house, the master of the family?" - My grandmother was not wanting to plead in return, her prerogative of woman, and mistress of the house; in fine, the wrangle was spun out a long half hour, and my uncle Dick's information, how he came to be kept so long in petticoats, not a whit more forwarded, till at last my grandfather was obliged to lend a deaf ear, and then, and not till then, my grandmother shewed sufficient reasons for pucellizing him; - telling him over and above, that as that day was his birth-day, she had herself taken care, unknown to his father, to</p>

            <note>image - decorative chapter break</note> <p>CHAP. IX.</p> <p>I Thought in one Chapter of reasonable length to finish the general idea I intended to give of my uncle Dick; but my memorandums were too many, either to forget, or to pass them over slightly. Indeed, the occurrences of the first part of his life are a mere bagatelle, and the intelligent Reader will judge them to be as uninteresting as I do myself; for if he had but an inkling of my taste, he would perceive it to be more refined than double refined sugar, or above proof, in flavour and quality like an excellent spirit. He would therefore indulge me so far as to firmly believe, that I hate nonsense more</p>

            <p>than he does himself, and that I would gladly discard it from my pen, were it not the fashion to be nonsensical. A person out of the fashion may as well be out of the world; so the ladies of quality think. Besides, as I have undertaken, at the sollicitation of many great lords of this land, both spiritual and temporal, including all the duchesses, countesses and baronnesses, any way conspicuous for exemplary lives, to write for their pleasure and profit, my own Life and Opinions, interlaced and concatenated with some striking incidents that deserved to rescue from oblivion a good portion of the Lives and Opinions of my illustrious progenitors, - I presumed, it was incumbent on me, as a faithful historian, whose face, one of these days, should not be made to blush for a misrepresentation of facts, to deliver every thought, word and deed, as they primitively existed amidst the graces of unaffected simplicity. 'Tis true, I have endeavoured, when the thing</p>
            <pb n="113" xml:id="pb-113" facs="#i125"/>
            <p>was too unseemly, to throw over it the veil of discretion. The same endeavour I shall also use for the future; for I hate the language of Billingsgate, though its constitution, genius and idioms are constructed on the radical appellations, our forefathers agreed among themselves by a solemn compact, to affix to their ideas.</p> <p>Long live therefore the clean Callico wrapper for things our depravity makes us ashamed of! The French may boast, for the same reason, of the bienseance of their double entendre, and cry vivat to it! The modest virgin finds it a preservative against the glow of blushes; at least, her appearing cool and unalarmed, is an apology, that she does not understand the second intention metaphysicians ascribe to it. The squeamish prude has a heart firm and undaunted, to bear up against the shock it may surprize her with. The grave matron already experienced in, or in the habit of experiencing the effects of connubial</p>

            <p>affections reputes it nothing more than a refinement upon nature, or the gross ideas of the vulgar expressed with delicacy. The minister of state, privy-counsellor, and judge, far from being of opinion that it is treasonable, or of a self-tendency to disturb the peace of his majesty's loyal and faithful subjects, consider it in the light of a pure recreation of the mind, and as such adopt it themselves with an exquisite goÃ»t, whenever they can unbend their application from business. The archbishop and bishop, notwithstanding the exterior austerity of manners they require from themselves, and the interior austerity required in them by others, regard it as an ingenious device, which occasional causes sometimes render necessary; they even can crack a joke in this way themselves, and yet, like Adam in the state of innocence, feel not, if you believe them, the least motion of concupiscence. The parson, whether he utters it himself, or hears it uttered, is always</p>

            <p>alert and gay; satisfaction glistens in his eyes till it begets a leer, and his simpering mouth leaves you to guess at an object that can warm his heart as well as October and Tobacco. I need not mention how the physician stands affected on this topic, it being well known that the indagation of nature is the aim of all his studies; so that when he has explored all her depths, we cannot be surprised that he has the face to recommend to his patients a regimen for preserving in a due tone their erector muscles, whether risible or subrisible.</p> <p>From the premises it will be inferred by the manager of his majesty's theatres, that I am a fautor of lax morality. Be it so; but how will these gentlemen make good the charge against me? 'Tis true, my grandfather was a little loose in his expressions; yet fancied no harm in it: my father thought it a matter of indifference, whether we should signify things</p>
            <pb n="116" xml:id="pb-116" facs="#i128"/>
            <p>by the terms of the original contract, or by the fitness of near, or remote analogy, as either might best serve to enrich our language. My uncle Dick was very decisive in this point, often affirming with great earnestness, that it was an absurdity not to be vindicated by any plausible pretext, to sham Abraham, or cheat the devil, as they call it, by specifying certain things and acts by any names but their own. His reason was, that though man is corrupt, and inclined to corruption, ever since the transgression of our first parents; yet he should strive with might and main to appear as if Adam had never sinned in him. Hence the language that prevailed in the state of innocence, in Paradise, in the golden age, ought to be used by him preferably to the Periphrasis, the Metaphor, the Allegory, the Aposiopesis, the Catachresis, all inventions of men, designed for palliating their arch tricks int he state of wickedness, in the indulgence of illicit pleasure,</p>
            <pb n="117" xml:id="pb-117" facs="#i129"/>
            <p>in the iron age of criminal correspondence. A child, said he, is ashamed of nothing, till his mama or governess chides and tells him it is a pawpaw word, a naughty thing; but would it not be better for us to be always as children, speaking and acting according to innocent nature, and not according to the sophistications which must perpetually put us in mind that nature is not genuine? - I should be partial, because these are the opinions of my grandfather, father and uncle Dick, were I to prefer them to the opinions of others on the same subject, - a subject, which seems to require a very nice dicusson. If man is rational, let him act the rational part. This cannot be better done than by removing the infatuation of prejudice from his judgment, especially the traditionary sort, which flatters, and courts, and wins the predilection of many, as being handed down from father to son. In this point of view therefore I make bold to censure all that</p>
            <pb n="118" xml:id="pb-118" facs="#i130"/>
            <p>the most rigid moralist can find amiss in these ticklish opinions of my grandfather, father and uncle Dick; and here are my reasons, without further apologizing for this act of degeneracy.</p> <p>I allow with my uncle Dick, that it were best to speak the language of the golden age, if it could now be spoken consistently with integrity of heart and purity of intention. It is evident it cannot. So soon as a word is hazarded, to which a complete idea of nastiness is annexed, the intention is immediately considered, and if found to denote depraved affections in the speaker, and to excite the same in the hearer, nothing can be offered in justification of the person, that so hazards it. A word not conveying a like complete idea of nastiness, but only an accessory one, such as the double entendre, is equally not justifiable, when the intention is bad: so that the intention, which is easily known, must be the test of all</p>
            <pb n="119" xml:id="pb-119" facs="#i131"/>
            <p>words in this kind. They are indeed good in themselves, because nothing natural is vicious, because nothing signified by analogy can be found fault with; but when once malice has appeared to have corrupted the heart, their use with a sinister intention cannot be free from the imputation of offence.</p> <p>However, it will be doubted by the serious, who may in their leisure hours be tempted to weigh minutely the merit of certain words, whether this question can be decided by all the divinity and law in his majesty's dominions. Many and warm must be the debates concerning the Letter and the Intention, particularly the Intention, as our divines make no account of it, either in saying or doing. this I can illustrate by an example. An eminent D. D. of the church of E-d, once in discourse with my father, exclaimed bitterly against the church of R-m for requiring an intention from her Clergy in</p>
            <pb n="120" xml:id="pb-120" facs="#i132"/>
            <p>the due discharge of all their ecclesiastical functions. "Why this intention of the church (said he) why is it enforced as an absolute condition? I think it one of the greatest absurdities in the world." My father very shrewdly answered: "Pray, reverend sir, can you preach a sermon, without intending to preach?" - The parson quite disconcerted, turned upon his heel, and sneaked off in the solemn pace and silence of an Areopagite.</p> <p>What a pretty thing it is to be able to retort absurdities! No Gordian knot can keep firm in its intricacies against the keen edge of a such a sword. - But I have said nothing yet of the licentiousness of authors, who often stand arraigned as debauchers of the chaste and modest world by their writings. Again the Intention starts up as a truth-telling witness; it will surely either acquit or condemn the author. However, it must be considered, that if the author in exposing the foibles</p>
            <pb n="121" xml:id="pb-121" facs="#i133"/>
            <p>of mankind, finds it necessary to descant upon the inside as well as outside of the incongruities he discovers in these foibles, as being unnatural, base in their tendency, impolite, unpolitical, or any way notorious for petulancy, - he is no more to be stigmatized with obloquy, or giving oblique descriptive hints of them, than the spirited preacher is for exercising with a nervous arm the evangelical lash upon the naked back of vice. Yet I would have the author wear some lace, fringe or embroidery, that he might not appear plain and homely, as Juvenal. The ladies undoubtedly, will here join me in opinion. They love something spruce, and gay, and brilliant. The rank clown with his clumsey hops on the trite turf, can never chequer their fancies with a like exuberance of delectable curiosity.</p> <p>If my uncle Dick, immediately after he had disrobed his anteriors and posteriors of petticoats, was so tenacious of</p>
            <pb n="122" xml:id="pb-122" facs="#i134"/>
            <p>his own opinions; in a word, of his own way of thinking and speaking, that the presence of very respectable persons, such as his mother, my lord bishop, or a court lady, could not bridle his tongue against telling them, in case the least ambiguity was perceptible in their discourse, that they meant so, and so, and so, and so; - if, I say, he was so tenacious of the pacta conventa <note>Latin</note> between the ancient modellers of our language, and if withal he was so unfortunate by taking up folks short with his meanings, that many a harmless lady had been brought to a burning shame and confusion by him. - I must notwithstanding, do this justice to his memory, that I can with a safe conscience exculpate him from any untoward affection of mind, or ill intention. He was as chaste as Diana, or rather, as insensible of all amourous parley or intercourse, as the wife of snow St. Francis of Assisium made for himself; so that I verily believe he carried his maidenhead with him to the</p>
            <pb n="123" xml:id="pb-123" facs="#i135"/>
            <p>grave. This cool and composed nature in him might, very probably, arise from the indisposition in his Scrotum, though some physicians think not: perhaps rather, it was from a sort of aversion he conceived for womankind; and for no other reason, as I could ever learn, than being detained so long in petticoats, when his indications of manhood ought to have made good more early in life his pretensions to the breeches. - But it is worth the Reader's while to know the second part of my uncle Dick's general history, which, I now can promise him, shall be entire and uninterrupted in the next Chapter.</p>

             <note>image - decorative chapter break</note> <p>CHAP. X.</p> <p>GREAT was the joy of my uncle Dick when he saw himself invested with the arbitrary insignia of virility by the hands of my grandmother. No knight elect of the most honourable order of the Garter, could go through the ceremonies of his installment with more alacrity. The house rung with congratulations, though not without some sarcastic sneers of the servant maids, particularly of Margery, the cook, who importuned him to produce his authorities for wearing the breeches. A Quo Warranto <note>Latin</note> of this extraordinary nature brought against him, was attended with no effect. His singular</p>
            <pb n="125" xml:id="pb-125" facs="#i137"/>
            <p>modesty waved the temptation to put in his plea; but he vowed to have his revenge of Margery, by singeing some time or other her Parenthesis, whose interposition, besides being the moving cause that gave him a relish for transmuting his species, would also by such a feu de joye, be a standing remembrancer to him of what had happened.</p> <p>The family's friends and relations, who assembled to celebrate this remarkable birth-day, were unanimous in approving my grandmother's fancy of the seaman's garb. My uncle Dick himself had no objections to it, and said he would with all his heart continue in the same fashion to the day of his death; but that he had no more desire of being an admiral, or commodore, or captain in his majesty's fleet; a snug tenement on terra firma, <note>Latin</note> suiting better his inclination for the peace of life, than being tossed about in a frail vessel on boistrous seas, and terrified with the roaring</p>
            <pb n="126" xml:id="pb-126" facs="#i138"/>
            <p>of cannon about his ears. As for pressing him into the service, he believed no brother tar would attempt it; and if it so happened, the ship's surgeon on inspecting his case, would immediately procure his discharge.</p> <p>The next morning, when sleep had allayed all the bustle of the natal festivity, except the bare remembrance of it, and the head-achs those complained of who had drank too liberally on the strength of it, my uncle Dick arose, full of thought, how he should occupy himself in a manner worthy of his new acquired manhood. I call it newly acquired, because, though it pre-existed in him, he was not sensible of its being so till then. - After a short alternation of thought, he resolved to dip into all arts and sciences, and to make himself master of such as his genius might have a predilection for as favourites. It would, he fancied, be required of him, as his dress shewed the seafaring man, to</p>
            <pb n="127" xml:id="pb-127" facs="#i139"/>
            <p>do something for improving the art of navigation. And indeed, he laboured in this point with great diligence a good part of his life. We are indebted to him for some excellent models, which, if carefully imitated, will be sufficient to prevent all mistakes in ship-building; for the most accurate manoeuvre, or working of ships in obliquity; for making more unerring the mariner's compass by the invention of the artificial magnet, specimens of which may be still seen among the curiosities of Sir Hans Sloane's collections in the British Museum; for several very ingenious processes, in order to facilitate the discovery of the Longitude and perpetual Motion; but this discovery, which has puzzled so many able mathematicians, he was often heard to say, would rather be the result of chance by some lucky hit, than owing to the researches of the industrious adventurer; an instance of which he further alledged, could be produced in himself: for one night in bed, whether</p>
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i140"/>
            <p>asleep or awake, he was not certain; but the longitude appeared to him as plain as the nose on his face, quite easy and intelligible like a hornbook to any Doctor of Divinity, and as tractable as any wife during the honey-moon. He applauded himself more than Pythagoras could do on finding the square of the two sides. In fine, to recall and fix the idea of his dear longitude, when the light of the morn opened his eyes, he struggled in vain. - "May be, said he, I shall remember how it was, if I lie flat on my back, and suppose to myself that I am looking through, like a busy star-gazer, a telescope indefinitely long, to take an exact observation of the Southern eye of the Bull. This dorsal incubation, after some time spent in it, by the two great pressure of the cerebrum upon the cerebellum, flagged to such a degree his powers of reminiscence, that besides wearing down what vestiges there might be of the longitude in his</p>
            <pb n="129" xml:id="pb-129" facs="#i141"/>
            <p>brain, he had just reason to apprehend a fit of the apoplexy. - To divert, therefore, the threats of this fatal disorder from his capital part, by a gentle evolution, he planted himself on his belly, his elbows supporting him, and facilitating a semi-erection of his eyes towards the tester of the bed. "Come, Longitude! (cried he) come, O come! let me now contemplate your celestial aspect, that being well acquainted with its features, I may charm the lords of the Admiralty with the description of them. - Stay; - how many thousand pounds sterling am I to get by you?" - Whilst he was recollecting how much the proposed premium for the discovery of the longitude was, having postponed the sight he had a certain expectance of from his invitation, - his elbows began to ache; he felt a pain in his neck, and another in the small of his back;  in a word, the ventral prostration was as uneasy as it was indecent; it bent the soul upon the earth</p>
            <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i142"/>
            <p>like that of a brute; it did not suit the supple play of his organs for exerting nice speculations. - Angry with himself he turns briskly upon his left side, saying, "Well, now or never, Mrs. Longitude; pray, did not I ferret you last night out of your lurking hole, and did not I afterwards, besides taking your exact dimensions, survey minutely all your attitudes? All this I did, without having recourse to the first meridian in one of the Azores; without observing Jupiter's Satellites from a marine chair; without consulting the Moon *, whether she had any influence over your constitution; without constructing a mariner's compass of ten feet diameter. - He scarce had gone through these interrogatorial expostulations, when he bethought himself that lying on the left side, was one of the unwholesome ways advised against by</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* It is on the exact knowledge of the motions of the moon, that the most reasonable hopes of discovering the longitude at sea seem founded.</p>

            <p>physicians; - for some of them have taken great pains to assure us, that the liver and lungs hanging from the right side, fall plumb upon the heart when we lie upon the left side, and their center of gravity, very burdensome and oppressive, bearing down upon the elastic spring of the vessels of the heart, must in a great measure impede the circulation of the blood, if not put a stop to it, when suffered to continue too long in the same situation without shifting it elsewhere. - This was enough for him to decline the meditation on his left side: a free circulation of his blood was highly necessary to his design, because it could not fail to beget a copious flow of good spirits. - Turn then he must on his right side. What doctor of the faculty could dispute with him the salubrity of so commodious a position? He tucked the bed-cloths under his shoulder, and shutting his left eye, and cocking his right eye to a hole of perfect perforation, formed every one</p>
            <pb n="132" xml:id="pb-132" facs="#i144"/>
            <p>knows how, by keeping partly lax and partly close the right-hand fingers just upon the line of life at the root of the thumb; - "Now once more (said he) - i dextro omine! <note>Latin</note> and you will find the longitude. - This is the thing, and the very thing! I take a right aim, through my right fist, with my right eye, on my right side, the circulation of my blood right, my animal spirits right, my conception right, my all right." He could not this time, as he was persuaded, have missed the longitude, had not a thought very industriously intrusive, boded that his liver would be overgrown, supposing the intenseness of the meditation had thrown him into a trance. Nay, he began to feel some symptoms of this overgrowth, and he was sorely afraid, if he did not quickly discuss it by altering his position, his liver would soon be as big as a rump of beef. - Such are the effects of physic-studying, when too much credit is given to the prognostic part! However, it is</p>
            <pb n="133" xml:id="pb-133" facs="#i145"/>
            <p>probable, he was here rather hipped by the longitude, than by any medical observation or inquiry. - He starts up dismayed, out of bed he bounces, stands naked in the middle of the floor, musing with a finger in his mouth; the cold pinches him, he gets to bed again, takes a warming, anon he tumbles and tosses about, somebody knocks at his door calling him to breastfast; - breakfast! breakfast! (quoth he) aye faith, very right; if I have lost sight of the longitude, hang it for me! there's no reason I should lose sight of my breakfast. - With these words he rises and dresses himself; but unhappily forgetting the longitude and latitude of his head, which were exactly determined by his sailor's bonnet, he claps on it its stead his chamber-pot, - by good luck there was nothing in it, - and with this conspicuous diadem he majestically struts into the breakfasting room, chaunting as he entered, a song extempore composed by him in imitation of that on</p>

            <p>in order the pleasures of his visionary lucubrations by the light of the moon, which the light of the sun had unhappily for him absorbed into the center of his vortex, where his dazzled eyes could not follow. - While he spoke, not one of the company was able to interrupt him, his tongue was hung with such volubility. However, whilst he was harranguing, and the rest laughing, my grandmother had the presence of mind to steal behind him, and slip the chamber-pot off his head into her apron. It was instantly conveyed away. This she did, either fearing that the nodding forwards of his head to humour the earnest telling of his story, would shake the pot off to the great injury of her china-ware on the table before him; or what is more natural to think, that none by imprudently putting him in mind of his mistake, should make him ashamed of himself. And indeed, such an oversight ought not in any one's thoughts create a disparagement</p>

            <p>of my uncle Dick: many great men, and as great as he, have amidst the wanderings of their minds through the mazes of the beaux arts, put on my mistake as unfashionable head-dresses.</p> <p>I am glad I have given the curious Reader this short detail of the noble struggle my uncle Dick made to con over his dream of the longitude. If every one attempted to scrutinize, as he did, the benefits accruing from their dreams, there would not be so many idle dreamers in the world, or persons who shew no plus ultra in their actions; or in fine, who do nothing but dream all their life. It was his constant care, if possible, to realize notions adjudged by the vulgar as immersed in the chaos of eternal night; but if sometimes, as Shakespeare says, "the airy fabrick of a vision leaves not a wreck behind:" so he, indeed, could not help being frustrated in his views, when he had no idea or apprehension, nothing to</p>

            <p>catch at, no magic power, spell, charm, or inchantment to leave engraved on some plate in the repository of his memory, what had only with a flourish skimmed over the surface of his brain. This I take to be the case in his sleeping moments. When he was broad awake, it was quite otherwise with him. Then he projected and put in execution like a philosopher; and would give rational answers, if the party behaved politely to all questions put to him in divinity, law, physic, mathematics, politics, et caetera. Behaving politely was a due deference to his judgment, and sometimes an unreserved acquiescence, at least, in appearance; for he could no more bear contradiction than a woman.</p> <p>There were, however, some unseasonable times, wherein it was not so convenient, especially for strangers, to propose questions to him on any matter of moment. If they did, they never received</p>
            <pb n="138" xml:id="pb-138" facs="#i150"/>
            <p>a direct answer; yet it was well worth their while to hear him talk, and to pick up his apothegms as they dropped from him. If all the world stood staring about him at these times, he was either insensible, or regardless of their presence. I have often been highly delighted with the pourtrait Horace has given us of the fanciful gentleman at Argos, and for no other reason than that there has existed an extraordinary man like my uncle Dick, though by the bye, as the Reader shall plainly see, not so universally extraordinary as he was; for in their manner of imagining there was this limitation of difference. The man of Argos confined the aberrations of his mind to the hearings of fine theatrical entertainments. If the actor played his part well, he clapped him; if ill, he hissed him; and all this was transacted, perhaps frequently in the open fields, or while he sat warming himself at his kitchen fire, or whilst he was taking a tour to the grandee-end of the</p>

            <p>town to pay his respects to the public orator, or whilst he nursed in bed a fit of the gout; whereas my uncle Dick, besides hearing comedies, tragedies, interludes, operas and concerts of vocal and instrumental music, whenever he pleased; of which, with all their concomitants of theatres, scenes, decorations, actors, actresses, prompters, box-keepers and candle-snuffers, he was himself in a moment of time the sole architect; - could also take a journey to any of the Planets, converse with the inhabitants, inspect into their customs and form of government; nay, he has been so bold an adventurer, if you have faith enough to believe him, as to take a close view of the primum mobile, - he is pretty confident, that the diameter of each of its main springs, of which he says there are three, is a million of times bigger than the diameter of our planetary world. Nothing can be more accurate, in his opinion, than the disposition of the machinery, which the</p>

It is situate, according to the actual survey he took of it, in a parallel line to the primum mobile, but with the length of almost the whole universe lying between; so that if a perpendicular was let to fall from the center of the primum mobile, it would rest towards the center of Hell. Here he had the honour and satisfaction of smoaking a pipe, and drinking a chearful glass with the Devil, the most sociable,</p>

            <p>free-hearted, best-natured, boon companion, jovial soul, and choicest spirit he ever met with. Many were the jokes they cracked together, particularly on the B-sh ministry for upwards of half a century past. The devil too gave him memorandums of a few state tricks and secrets, but said he would not blame the ministers; they were his best friends, and the defunct of the tribe were exceeding useful to him in dispelling the gloominess of his cares, by telling him stories of their wantonness, and when they had nothing else to do, by roasting chesnuts for him, which they made palatable with a batch of good Burgundy.</p> <p>My uncle Dick in his excursions upon the face of this our earth, made nothing as a General, commanding in chief a well disciplined army, of defeating a hundred thousand Turks and Tartars: sometimes he smote them so Ã¡ platte coÃ»tre, that but one escaped to give an account of</p>
            <pb n="142" xml:id="pb-142" facs="#i154"/>
            <p>their discomfiture. Not long before the demise of queen Anne, he was very near bringing in the Ch-r, had he not been counter-schemed; some say, out-witted; others made a dupe of by H- earl of O-d, who pretended to be warm in the same cause, but left all the friends to it in the lurch. - "I afterwards grinned heartily, said my uncle Dick, to see him in quality of scullion to one of the inferior imps of Tartarus, stewing the ears and noses of sycophants, as sauce for a Westphalia Ham: I paid him also the compliment of hoping that he liked his place and pension.". - "Ah! replied his quondam lordship, fetching a deep sigh, I once flattered myself that the maxim, quid enim salvis infamia nummis? <note>Latin</note> was as much christian as it is modernly political; but now to my cost I find the reverse." - I should tire out the gentle Reader's patience, and my own, were I here to enumerate the notable words and deeds of my uncle Dick. I</p>
            <pb n="143" xml:id="pb-143" facs="#i155"/>
            <p>shall, therefore, with more convenience to myself, and perhaps to others, treat of them occasionally in these Memoirs under the title of his Reveries. None but his intimate friends and relations could restrain his impetuosity when he had thus got mounted on the mettlesome pinions of fancy; and strangers, as I have observed, always found him a perfect Proteus, transforming himself into a continued chain of miracles; yet all differing in their essential attributes, or length, breadth and thickness, pursuant to the exactness of the dissimilarity set forth in Leibnitz's system of Indiscernables.</p> <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I must say something of the manner of recreation whereby my uncle Dick used to unbend his thoughts from the troubles of this life. There was a Horse, an humble and faithful servant of his during upwards of thirty years, to which he had given the name of Tristram Shandy, in presence of</p>
            <pb n="144" xml:id="pb-144" facs="#i156"/>
            <p>a cloud of witnesses. If my poor uncle Dick was now alive, he would undoubtedly have brought by a compulsive warrant before some justice of the Quorum, a r-v-r-nd Pr-d-y of Y-k, for being so boldfaced as to usurp the name of his horse, with a tack of gentleman to it, instead of gentlehorse. But this by the bye. - Caesar and Pompey's names are now given to dogs, and this may be a reason to induce the parson that personated my uncle Dick's horse, to assume his name, chusing rather to be of the equine than canine species, which, indeed, is very probable from the singular affection he expresses for pack and hobby-horses. This also by the bye. Now Tristram Shandy, my uncle Dick's gentlehorse, but not gentleman, was one of the gentlest beasts that ever trod in shoe-iron. It is very astonishing that he was so; for in reality he was not deficient in any of the perfections of a compleat horse. As he was never known to give or receive a love-challenge,</p>
            <pb n="145" xml:id="pb-145" facs="#i157"/>
            <p>though often in company with, and sometimes wooed by some of the most sightly mares in the paddock, it was firmly believed by the country folks, that my uncle Dick had practised some charm upon him to keep him chaste. The truth is, my uncle Dick never did; but he was pleased to say in vindication of himself and his horse, that there was a sympathy between them of passions and affections; that as he had no appetite himself to stray out of the biass of chastity, so neither had his horse; and that withal, if persons were skilled in his language, and as intimately connected with him as himself was, they would find him a profound philosopher, and in argumentation so close, or speaking so much to the purpose, that he generally delivered himself in the syllogism or enthymem: yet this precision might be owing, he added, to his being a horse of few words.</p>
            <pb n="146" xml:id="pb-146" facs="#i158"/>
            <p>A further descriptive illustration of the qualities and qualifications of the horse must seem unnecessary to a judge of horseflesh; so that in one word for all, I may safely avouch for it, that he was a good nag; quiet and harmless; grave and composed; exempt from all passion and prejudice; a lover of publick and private tranquility; proud of his own rider; complaisant to others if it so happened; but my uncle Dick would never let any body ride him, ever since a rude, illiterate country 'squire borrowed him once for his grandmother to go to church with, but run himself for sweepstakes on a common. 'Tis true, poor Tristram Shandy Gentlehorse, was distanced: it was contrary to the nature of the beast to contend, having no worldly emulation in him; and tho' the 'squire laid most unmercifully about his ribs and bum with whip and spur, he never quickened his pace the more, bearing all with a philosophic patience.</p>
            <pb n="147" xml:id="pb-147" facs="#i159"/>
            <p>Mounted on this horse, my uncle Dick rode within ten or twelve miles of home, but scare ever farther, all about the country. - Three or four times, indeed, he took him to France with him on a visit to madam Pompadour. - His view, as I said, was a relaxation from the pains of his philosophical researches. He was under a necessity by his disorder to make use of a side-saddle, and he thought he might with as much decency ride that way, as a French lady astride. No bit or bridle stiffly held in a proud bow Tristram Shandy's neck; it followed the direction of his native meekness. It was so best, that my uncle Dick might be at liberty to play on his fife, or hautboy, or bagpipes some merry catch of the times, commonly to the tune of "A wicked old peer," "Tantarara rogues all;" "Over the water to Charley;" "The king shall enjoy his own again;" "The flowers of Edinburgh;" "Gee ho dobbin," and the like. - To whatever town, village, or</p>

            <p>hamlet he came, a silence mixed with admiration reigned among the inhabitants. Here comes Queen Dick! the word and summons those abroad gave to those within to run out and take a peep at him. The cobler suspends his operations on his old shoes, and quitting his stall, accompanies him more than half a street; gossiping wives at the bakehouse, stand as mute as fishes at the door, gazing at him passing by; the taylor nimbly skips off his work-board, and little minds stepping into the kennel in his vamps, so he has a full sight of him; the barber leaves a ready money customer in the suds, or half shaved and can't help fetching a gape as well as those that have nothing to do; all the little boys and girls, the instant they hear his musick, a sign to them that he is not far off, throw away their bread and butter, and in clusters, saluting him with bows, court'sies, and kiss-hands, familiarly ask him, "How d'ye do, uncle Dick!" He usually rewards their kindness with</p>

            <p>little toys, all of his own making; and those that do not partake of his bounty this time, are sure of it the next. Their mothers let them sometimes scamper after him a whole mile of ground, notwithstanding the malevolent predictions of a paultry almanack-maker, that he would at long run kidnap them as the piping rat-catcher did the children at Hamelen in the electorate of Hanover. - Such is the general account, with a few particulars of the life my uncle Dick led.</p> <note>image - decorative chapter break</note> <p>CHAP.

One  of the ladies, who also took upon herself to be mistress of the ceremonies, commanding silence, began with this question, "Why does a Miller wear a while hat?" The solution was obvious in every one's opinion, and having in order told what they thought it was, one saying, that he wore</p>
            <pb n="152" xml:id="pb-152" facs="#i164"/>
            <p>a white hat, because the dust of his mill and bags of meal had made it so; another, because he bought it originally white, there being no necessity for having it dyed black, according to the logical axiom, which recommends the non-multiplying of beings without necessity; as it would be both absurd and unnecessary to go to the expence of a black hat, and have it immediately spoiled with meal-dust; powdered hats not being in fashion, tho' powdered wigs are, and powdered hats besides, becoming none but fools, if we except Millers and Barbers. - this was the decision of a young gentleman lately come from the university; and to corroborate what he had advanced, he added that he could demonstrate it, both Ã  priori and Ã  posteriori with a reduction to the impossibility of being otherwise. - His arguments might seem to the worshipful corps of aldermen, as much powdered with the dust of the schools, as the Miller's hat with the dust of his mill.</p>
            <pb n="153" xml:id="pb-153" facs="#i165"/>
            <p>For the ladies part, their unlogical capacities unfortunately put a misconstruction upon the terms, "Beings ought not to be multiplied without necessity." They imagined, at least three of them gave broad hints of it, that the Oxford scholar had a mind to put them to the blush by a preposterous lecture on the decorum of female honour, which must be ruined, if they multiplied their beings without necessity, meaning, out of wed-lock; that indeed they could answer for it, one and all, that their virtue was without blemish, like new fallen snow; that neither crack nor flaw could be found in them to argue a depucellation; and that he must be a vile fellow that could undertake to asperse them on the score of multiplication.</p> <p>The Oxonian was irritated to the highest degree to observe the reception, his acute reasoning on the Miller's hat had been complimented with. "Lord! (cried </p>

(answered one of them;) but I hope you don't lay the indiscretion at any of our doors." - "Not for the world, madam," (said I, putting in a word to bring about a peace;) "would the gentleman pass so unjust a</p>

None of the ladies, as conscious to themselves of being exceeding upright, were offended at any ticklish circumstance of the nuptial song; on the contrary, they thought the whole vastly pretty, and were not a little inquisitive to know who the fair impostor was, which I begged to be excused telling, leaving them at full liberty to pick as wide a hole as they lifted in the apron of any gallant adventurer, they knew, or heard talk of.</p> <p>The whole company being now reinstated in all the mirth and wit they designed to set out with at first meeting, madam Cassandra said she would resume her conundrum of the miller's white hat, and as none had assigned a sufficient reason for his wearing it, she thought it incumbent on her to assure them, which she did with a countenance composed to airs of exact seriousness, that the miller's sole intention, or chief view, or original design in wearing a white hat, "Was to</p>

            <p>keep his head warm.' - This is the very mark I have been all along aiming at: my father's motive for having his consultabund physicians displayed with emblematical indications of knowledge, was undoubtedly couched in the abstruseness of a sort of conundrum. He must have considered, that their science being conjectural, required something so set it in the light of certainty, particularly in regard to vulgar understandings, whose estimate of things is in proportion to their outward shew. Now I have demonstrated in the sixth chapter, among other material points, that physic is a conjectural science, and that the professors of it are conjecturally learned. Therefore, as all conjectural learning leans upon a conjectural foundation, and as a single blast of a more probable conjecture, may blow the whole conjectured superstructure into atoms; my father's notion, as it could not be otherwise than I say; was conjecturatis conjeturandis, not an idle</p>
            <pb n="165" xml:id="pb-165" facs="#i177"/>
            <p>vagary, but solid and substantial. And this, I presume, is one of the clearest solutions of this matter that can be offered.</p> <p>One of the ancient philosophers, if I mistake not, it was Plato, having defined man to be "An animal with two feet, and without feathers," - Diogenes, or Democritus, I don't remember which it was, catches a cock, plucks off all his feathers, and exposes him in this state of nudity in Plato's school; "There (says he) is Plato's man!" The scholars laughed heartily, and well they might, to see such a comical figure of a man. - Let us suppose that all divines, lawyers and physicians are cocks; for there is a great analogy between them: - they strut about with the solemn gravity of cocks, to be stared at with reverential awe by others, whom they look down upon, as chickens; they have spurs like cocks to their heels, with which they are sure to gall every soul that is smitten with the folly of being ridden, or</p>
            <pb n="166" xml:id="pb-166" facs="#i178"/>
            <p>rather trod by them; their claws are nimble as cokcs claws to scrape up dung-hills, but with this difference, when the jewel is laid fast hold of, they never wish the barley-corn in its place; the cock is glad, when in cocking up his tail, he can shew glossy feathers of different sizes; so are they, when they have got gaudy folks dancing after their posteriors for pieces of advice, which they dispose of for ready money only, from one shilling, to one pound and upwards, per piece: the cock has wings, which he expands, claps against his sides, and brushes on the ground to serve purposes best known to himself; so do they pretend to have wings, and for purposes not unknown; they expand them to skreen, they say, the distressed under the shadow of their protection; they clap them against their sides as a mark of self-approbation for the lucre they have secured, and they sometimes brush them on the ground to shew that they can occasionally stoop to meanness: the cock can make a ruff of the feathers about his neck in a fit</p>
            <pb n="167" xml:id="pb-167" facs="#i179"/>
            <p>of anger, and if the feathers do not quickly subside, it is a sign he has a mind to pick a quarrel, or will not part without a blow; in like manner, they shrug up their shoulders, pointed with the spirit of resentment, and if you persist in provoking them, they will deal blows, most commonly by a slight of hand, but so sore, that you will have reason to sup sorrow for them: two cocks cannot agree, so neither can two divines, two lawyers, two physicians: cocks wear gills, for the same reason they wear bands; but what this reason is I never could discover; perhaps, it may be an index of some latent importance: cocks have the faculty of crowing, and when the crowing is out of season, old wives think it ominous; a divine crows when he preaches, a lawyer when he pleads your cause, and a physician when he feels your pulse; but crowing with them at another time, prognosticates some fatality; then they do not crow for, but crow over you: a cock is for the most</p>

            <p>part pecking at something, and picking it up to fill his craw; when divines, lawyers and physicians are busy at the like work, you may say they have got into their element: a cock has got a gizzard in which stick things of heterogeneous kind; a like heterogeneous compound adheres stubbornly to theological, legal, and medical gizzards: a cock gallants the hen, and will not suffer another cock, if he can help it, to gallant them; - Here I am puzzled to make out the analogy, but do not despair some time or other to produce a sufficient number of precedents in support of it. - A cock has a smart, brisk eye; I never observed a divine, lawyer, or physician with a sheepish look: a cock wears on his head an indented comb; I will not say, that divines, lawyers and physicians are coxcombs; all I mean is, that the present fashion has covered their heads with a texture of hairs not their own, being borrowed, and often stolen from the heads, tails, and beards</p>
            <pb n="169" xml:id="pb-169" facs="#i181"/>
            <p>of old women, old mares, old cows, old she-goats, old she-monkies, or any other villose antiquated female animal of the rational or brute species. - Of what is intended by the indented parts of these hairy compositions I shall have an occasion to speak bye and bye. - And now I pray, in closing this analogy, that all divines, lawyers and physicians will take in good part what I have said, imputing all the spleen, rancour and malevolence they may make a charge of to the strictness of the analogy, and not to me; for I myself in right earnest love and esteem a good divine and a good physician; their value is as of things that come from afar. As for a good lawyer, I have the same opinion of him as the French Proverb, bon avocat, mauvais voisin.</p> <p>Having made divines, lawyers, and physicians cocks, by virtue of analogy, as appears from the premises, they ought to be defined in contradistinction to Plato's</p>
            <pb n="170" xml:id="pb-170" facs="#i182"/>
            <p>definition, "Animals with two feet, and with feathers." The first part of the definition is in some measure accidental to them; for if by some accident they lose their feet, or the use of them, they may adopt supplemental ones of wood, or support themselves on crutches. The other part of the definition is an essential attribute, without which they can neither be, nor be conceived; for if you strip them of their feathers, they will instantly become objects of derision like Diogenes's deplumated cock; that is, they will be held in no consideration, their talents and capacity will be suspected, and their fame of learning will vanish as a bubble. What is a b-p, if you cut off his l-n sl-ves, or a p-n, if his g-n is stripped over his ears? Consecration and orders, so they say themselves, retain no indelible characters; therefore in case of denudation, divinity must be kicked down stairs, and it will fit quite easy upon them, if their condition is altered into grooms</p>

            <p>of the stool, or pages of the back-stairs. - If a judge should sit, every way resembling a journeyman taylor, to hear an important and knotty cause, would not the whole court imagine, that instead of cabbaging their judgments, he was cabbaged of his own? and if a serjeant at law, barrister, or counsellor, was to stand up and plead in a greasy striped flannel waistcoat, such as butchers have on to celebrate their marrow-bone and cleaver revels, would not the client give the cause over for lost, and conclude his lawyer was bewitched? - Take from a physician his bushy wig, the steel skewer he keeps dangling from his hip, the chariot he flants about the town with, the pair of horses he and his man are mounted on in the country; he is no more the renowned Hippocrates; he dwindles into the 'pothecary's pestle and mortar-man. - At any rate, these cocks of the game can do nothing, can know nothing, are worth nothing, without the wig of the certain form and dimensions,</p>
            <pb n="172" xml:id="pb-172" facs="#i184"/>
            <p>peculiar to each of them. Within the precinct of this wig are laid up the most precious treasures to their intellects; yet the qualities are so occult, that to this day it remains undecided by chymical scrutators, whether one scruple with a real existence can be extracted from the whole collected mass. However, the exterior indented parts of the wig, comprehending buckles, frizures, toupees, cylindrical tails, tails with knots, oblong strait tails, sweepers on each cheek and below the paps as judges have them, focuses distinguished by their rays on the crown, and crowns without focuses, abound with many smiling fancies; all indebted for their pre-valency to the nature of the animal, which afforded hairs for the ingenious composition: so that if the hairs of an old woman are predominant, the wearing party is remarkably endowed with the sense of an old woman; if the case stands otherwise, he is cowish, goatish, apish, just as it happens.</p>
            <pb n="173" xml:id="pb-173" facs="#i185"/>
            <p>There's another advantage annexed to these wigs, and this is, that by their close action upon the skull, they have such a coercive power over its solid parts, as to force them towards the center of the pineal gland, that they may be constant inhabitants, if possible, in the outlets of this residence of the soul. This, I believe, was the reason, why a clergyman of my acquaintance, the incumbent of several benefices, made night-caps of his cast off day wigs. In unbeneficed life, he often preached bald-pated, and did not mind how much of his solid sense was detached from the center; but ever since, he grew so retentive of it in his wigs, that it was not known in the memory of man to have transpired a hair's breadth in praying, preaching, teaching, and catechising. In fine, whilst he lived, he lived happily, and had a great deal in him, if he would but shew it.</p>

            <p>To recapitulate all that has, or can be said on this interesting subject, let us take it for granted, that a study of three times seven years in any of the divisions of conjectural learning, will not signify a button, if the superficial apparatus be wanting. What makes people stand in awe of spirits? it is because they are shades. If we thought them palpable, we would not long keep aloof; we should shake hands familiarly with them; and as familiarity breeds contempt, we might soon use them as the frogs did kind Log. It is therefore the shadow and not the substance, the bark and not the pith of learning, that fixes our admiration and respect. And indeed, I have often regretted that the scarcity of the current coin of the kingdom in my pocket, put it out of my power to purchase at least one of the learned sort of wigs: But as times go, I must content myself with a cut bob, and appear in the eyes of the world as curtailed of all learning and respect by</p>

            <p>must their rigging be so and so? that they might appear learned in their way. Here is the right, clear, full and only solution of this grand conundrum!</p> <p>My father, that nothing might be wanting to declare the importance of his Consult, communed with  my uncle Dick on the nicest manner of contriving a repast for the physicians; "for you know, (says he,) that fine cerere et baccho friget venus, <note>Latin</note> not that I would have the physicians, egged on by the stimulus of a dinner, to get my wife with child for me; but their hospitious reception attended with the expectation of the good fees I promised them, will no doubt, prevail upon them to disclose to us some of their most accurate and best authenticated arcanums on the art of generation. - It also came into my head to invite some of the beaux espirts to be partakers of this dinner. I am sure parson Yorick, at my request, will give us some droll sermon; we shall not fail to</p>
            <pb n="177" xml:id="pb-177" facs="#i189"/>
            <p>hear some sort of rhapsody from Dr. Rantum, and honest S- F-te will perform the part of Balatro; - you may remember what a droll Balatro was at the Caena of Nasidienus in Horace. - All this will be a superaddition of seasoning to the meats and sauces, which, brother Dick, let it be your province to provide on this emergency, in the most elegant taste, that the whole may be conducted with the utmost solemnity." - My uncle Dick having in a short pause, weighed well the merits of the cause of this entertainment, the qualities of the guests, and the aliments best adapted to their stomachs, replied, that it was necessary the constituent parts of the symposion should all exhibit the cruditus luxus <note>Latin</note> of Petronius, and that in order thereto he would make it his intire study to collect whatever was most rare and exquisite. - "Give yourself no farther trouble about it, (added my uncle Dick;) I'll do the business; you may go sleep; I'll do it, you may depend upon it, better</p>

            <p>than any master of the revels throughout his majesty's dominions."</p> <p>My father was so well pleased with my uncle Dick's obsequiousness; for he did not despair of the resources of his genius in bringing to bear remarkables of any kind; that without more ado, he fixed the day, and dispatched message cards noticing the same to his physicians and the beaux espirts. They all sent word back they would not fail; my uncle Dick had concerted his measures; every particular was in a fair a way of turning out right as could be wished.</p> <p>The day came, and the physicians were the first that made their appearance. It was meet they should, as it was on their account the game was started. There was a moat near my father's house, from which by the help of a spying glass one might reconnoitre the whole country at the distance of seven miles all around.</p>
            <pb n="179" xml:id="pb-179" facs="#i191"/>
            <p>My father ascended this moat for speculation, by the time he judged some of his guests must have been within sight. He saw something moving along, but could not devine what to make of it. By degrees the object drawing nearer, became more and more distinguishable. At length what should it be, but the three physicians, superbly mounted on wheel-barrows, advancing in a parallel line to each other, and pushed along by six able bodied men, two to each a barrow, working a handle a piece with a vigorous tenacity of their fists, seconded by the protrusive force of every robust muscle that could be played off to advantage. As they had taken their route through bye and lone ways, and in such a vehicle, my father, if he had vulgar ideas, must have been afraid of their going to heaven, instead of coming to his house; but he was really astonished to think what could induce them to ride in a manner so ridiculous to themselves and painful to their</p>
            <pb n="180" xml:id="pb-180" facs="#i192"/>
            <p>drivers, unless it was to make game of himself. Resolved that they should not be a disgrace to him, he runs to meet them, and was lucky enough to put a stop to their march, just by the side of a wood, and within half a mile of his house. They excused themselves to him for not being on horseback. One pretended that his horse was afflicted with the spavin; another that his, was desperately ill of the glanders, and therefore it was not safe to bring him into the company of other cattle; and the third protested that a wicked servant had rid his, so hard the day before over a stony road, that one of the poor beasts hoofs was clean knocked off. My father did not so much mind their apologies, for he made no answer to them, as their dress, which he thought to be little outrÃ©. Their caps were quadrangular, and of hare-skins, with a tuft of scuts intermixed with ears, both of the same animal, on the crown; and from the cheeks round about the</p>

            <p>neck, were sewed into the lower edge of the caps, cat-tails, gradually encreasing in length and thickness, till a huge tail longer and thicker than any of the rest, fell directly upon the nape of the neck. From whence their beards were borrowed, did not then appear to my father; but it seemed to him that they were an exceeding great curiosity: the hairs held firm by their roots, and the roots were fixed in their own sockets, without receiving the least detriment from the hands of the leather-dresser, whose art in making the skin soft and pliable could not be too much admired. These beards, which reached down to their girdles in a fine taper, were kept close round the lower jaw-bone by wires hung about the ears. They were of different colours; one was coal-black, another was blood-red, and the other blue; and as the physicians chused to be nameless, they suffered themselves to be distinguished by their beards; the eldest being called doctor Blue-beard; the</p>
            <pb n="182" xml:id="pb-182" facs="#i194"/>
            <p>second in age, doctor Black-beard; and the youngest, doctor Red-beard. Their whiskers, of the same colour of their beards, were taken from large He-Cats, but no so thinly sown as usually on cats; by what sort of cement they were stuck on the upper lip, I could never learn; the doctors begged to be excused divulging so extraordinary a secret. Their wigs consisted of cows and horse-tails, out of which the bone was taken: no other cunning was required to make them, than stitching the tails together, and disposing them so, as that the horse-tails might flow before, and the cow-tails behind, without crisping them into any other curls than what were natural to them. The Doctors necks were embellished with a sort of band; I know not what to call it; it was like the neck-cloth used by charity-school girls. Each doctor had the complement of fifty yards of black baize in his robe; the edging was of cats-fur, and the girdle of swathe for keeping it</p>

            <p>tight about the waist, of scarlet broad ribbon, figured with Talismans. Whether they wore breeches or no, it could not be discerned, because their robes reached before over their toes; and behind formed a long sweeping tail.</p> <p>My father, soon after he had accosted them, excepted against the cats-tails to their caps, with the beards and whiskers, which, he said, there was no occasion for: as for the rest, they might be tolerable enough. The doctors would allow of no manner of exception, alledging that every article about them was essential to their knowledge, being points of artificial memory, which on seeing or feeling, they could remember immediately what to say. My father hereupon readily acquiesced; but desirous they would not come near his house in their wheel-barrows, they agreed to leave them behind in a thicket of the wood, and accompanied him afoot, the drivers bearing up their tails for state</p>
            <pb n="184" xml:id="pb-184" facs="#i196"/>
            <p>sake. However, here also another incongruity, and a great one, occurred to my father. What opinion should folks have of walking physicians? But as the case was now remediless, he bethought himself it would be most adviseable to shew them in by the back-door; and so he did, not one but the kitchen-maid being privy to the entry. - The beaux espirts arrived in a few minutes after my father was seated in the parlour with his physicians. Parson Yorick came on his humble minded steed; doctor Rantum stepped brisk and gay out of his chariot; and 'squire F-te made a brilliant appearance in a landau and four.</p> <p>And now I warn the Reader to whet his appetite for the next volume.</p> <p>End of the FIRST VOLUME.</p> <note>stamp reads 'BIBLICANTACAD'</note>
