             <p>Scarcely any are dissatisfied - nor can be said to groan under the grievance of this weighty impost - so that, at first sight, it appears to be none: - on the contrary, the public receiving thereby a particular gratification, consonant to modern ideas of liberty; are so far from murmuring, that every one pays it with the utmost pleasure.</p> <p>'Tis the price of the thing - and not at all extravagant, when we come to consider the quantity as well as the quality.</p> <p>Those, who agreeable to the practice of their profession, are obliged to procure the earliest intelligence for their guests and customers, profit by the expence they are at - </p>

            <p>Salubrious shines serene - sweetly contrasted</p> <p>With BAGNIGGE-BOTTOM and dread HOCKLET - 'th'-HOLE!</p> <p>There is also a well-toned Bell - not ear-piercing sharp, nor melancholy deep - by the famous Gloucestershire bell-founder.</p> <p>The Time-piece within the chapel, is by the celebrated GRIGNION, wonderful horometer and horologist! - and so just are its movements, that, it is observable, the women of fashion esteem it a perfect regulator; and commonly set their repeaters by it - during the psalm-singing part of the service.</p> <p>The Pulpit and Reading-desk, which are richly carved with grotesque heads and ornaments, cost seventy-two pounds - and the sounding-board is so admirably constructed, that the gentlest whisper, may be conveyed to the dullest ear, in the remotest corner!</p> <p>The TEN COMMANDS, the LORD'S PRAYER and the CREED are highly finished, flourished, and beautifully diversified in all the known characters of EUROPE - and set in matchless Papier-machÃ© frames, gleaming with burnished gold!</p> <p>The coved-canopy-roof, or cieling is FRET in FRESCO - the walls stuccoed - the pavement, modern Mosaic of finest fancy - the whole insuperably brilliant!</p>

            <p>The pews, many of which are faced with azure blue and Saxon green, studded with lacquered broad-headed spikes - at present, bring in only two hundred and fourscore pounds a year - but may be easily improved to four hundred and forty or fifty, without crowding the company, and allowing sufficient lolling-room.</p> <p>There is no expence of clerk, or pew-openers - they being amply considered out of the Christmas offerings, commonly called box-money - </p> <p>No expence of organist - for, as yet, there is no organ - but there is one building - which, when put up, the organist, together with the voices and minstrels to be provided, will be compensated by VOLUNTARY SUBSCRIPTION.</p> <p>There are only twenty-five coaches and chariots, and seventeen sedans, who honour the chapel with their devotions at present - but it is computed the number will be trebled - as soon as the ORCHESTRA is opened.</p> <p>The surplice-fees (which should rather be stiled sublime considerations and stately donatives) - are evidently upon the increase; from the amiable and benevolent disposition of the better sort - who choose to have the mystical rite of MATRIMONY and the solemnity of BAPTISM, performed by the chaplain, in preference to their parish-rector.</p>

            <p>The cryptic dormitory, in which will be deposited only the remains of people of fashion, promises, in a short time, to bring in a genteel harvest of golden orbicular memorials, silk scarves, hatbands, &amp;c.</p> <p>The surplices, pulpit-cloths and cushions, BASKERVILLE'S great bible, little thumbed and bound in blue Turkey, with broad silk registers and gold fringes - three folio common-prayers, in rich bindings - the communion-plate, &amp;c. to be taken at a fair appraisement.</p> <p>Any young clergyman, of a pleasing person, an engaging demeanour, a musical voice, and a graceful delivery, may now have an opportunity of displaying such envied and rarely-united talents, to the best advantage - nor need any other apply.</p> <p>A genteel premium is expected.</p> <p>For further particulars, inquire of A. B. at the MITRE, in PETTY FRANCE - or C. D. at the CROSS KEYS, in LITTLE BRITAIN - or E. F. at SIMON MAGUS'S Head, in the OLD JEWRY.</p> <p>Secresy if required.</p>

            <p>Civil employments of considerable trust and profit, requiring virtue and knowledge to discharge (to the disgrace of Government, and the eternal infamy of such governors as profit themselves thereby, or connive at it in others) are cried in public Newspapers, and bought and sold, and chopt and swopt - and even knocked down to the highest bidder.</p> <p>Military men, however deserving, if they expect promotion, must owe it to their money - not merit.</p> <p>Men of interest advertise for moneyed-men - moneyed-men for men of interest.</p>

            <p>I don't remember, as yet, to have seen any men of war, either floating, or upon the stocks, advertised for sale - but Indiamen, both ways, are bought and sold every day.</p> <p>However, a rich man may buy a borough - (they have been frequently advertised) sooner than a poor man can buy a beef-steak - according to the present advanced price of markets.</p> <p>The man who purchases his employment, or his seat - concludes he has a right to make the best - that is, the most of it.</p> <p>In short, we have among us, as is apparent from the daily prints, church-brokers,</p>
            <pb n="56" xml:id="pb-56" facs="#i58"/>
            <p>state-brokers, borough-brokers, army-brokers, navy-brokers, India-brokers, Jew-brokers, - with such an infinity of other brokers, as sufficiently announces, this once Christian and flourishing country to be (if not suddenly prevented) - upon the eve of its bankruptcy.</p> <p>Abuses have been too frequent in all times - but they were never openly avowed in print till now - We have not only parted with our conscience, but we appear to have lost all decency.</p> <p>Usurious offices are declared to be opened - usurious bargains are driven in Newspaper advertisements - any man</p>

            <p>friends that will supply them at - two or three hundred per Cent. discount.</p> <p>The spirit of gambling among us is now at such a height, fomented by news and advertisements, that we may venture to pronounce, there is full as much foul gambling as fair trade carried on in our emporium.</p> <p>The spirit of gambling and thirst for gold is become so insatiable, as to absorb every generous and manly passion - We are deaf to the cries and senseless to the softest sympathies of nature - in proof of which, we pit (as the witless phrase it) our dearest friends, and open policies upon the lives of our nearest relations.</p>
            <pb n="59" xml:id="pb-59" facs="#i61"/>
            <p>It should seem as if one half of the nation were the avowed bawds and brokers, to the imaginary wants and inordinate desires of the other half.</p> <p>Churches and charity-sermons - declared bawdy-houses and notorious private receptacles, we commonly find advertised in the same papers, and often in the same page: - Surely we don't stand in need of Newspapers to direct us to our parish-churches? - and houses of improper entertainment (thanks to our justices!) are to be found in plenty - without public advertisements.</p> <p>Panders thereby publish their abilities - bawds make offer of their freshest goods - prostitutes proclaim their apartments</p>
            <pb n="60" xml:id="pb-60" facs="#i62"/>
            <p>- and infamous dealers offer to public sale, such wares, as they dare not cry in any other open market, not even sell in the open face of day.</p> <p>Quacks seem to be the only adepts and men of genius among us - and quackery, another term for liberal art, profound science and acknowledged sufficiency: - Every one will hearken to the voice of him, who impudently asserts, and plausibly presents - and, however ill-qualified to discharge or demonstrate what he may have undertaken, let him not be discouraged; but, with unblushing confidence, set his face to the matter, and there can be no doubt of the public favour and patronage: - The public, as well as their betters, are remarkably</p>
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i63"/>
            <p>generous and well-disposed - towards the most undeserving. - Every day's advertisements confirm this truth.</p> <p>The many mischiefs in private life, which we owe to public advertisements, may be more easily imagined than asserted: - But imagination must not be wantonly indulged, in a work wherein the writer professes to have no other object, but truth, and an earnest desire of being useful: - After hinting at some of the most striking, the reader is left to judge for himself.</p> <p>The young, the giddy and the inexperienced of both sexes, are in hourly danger of being seduced and drawn aside to incurable mischiefs by Newspaper invitations:</p>
            <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i64"/> <p>- Boys and girls are instructed how they may shake off the obedience due to their parents: - Wards are directed where they may find, A GENTLEMAN of undeniable character, who will enable them to get rid of their troublesome guardians: - Minors, of great expectation, may meet with generous, advertising friends, who commiserate their unhappy state, and join with them in chiding the dull HOURS, that limp so heavily away! - and, after some few preliminaries settled, will point out to them the best and most effectual means of - spending their fortunes before they come of age.</p> <p>Apprentices are taught how they may, after the easiest manner - forfeit their indentures:</p>
            <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i65"/>
             <p>- And covenanted workmen, are most earnestly invited and sweetly tempted - to break their contracts.</p> <p>A YOUNG LADY of great BEAUTY and MERIT (jaded out with tramping the streets, sick of a town-life, and sort with midnight bruises! - and apprehending another BRIDEWELL-lying-in, may go harder with her than the last) advertises for a PARTNER for LIFE -</p> <p>She is not without FRIENDS, FORTUNE, nor ADMIRERS - but she has not yet met with the MAN, for whom she has hitherto preserved her spotless HEART - and has made a Vow never to part with her HAND till she does! - Her sentiments of the DELICATE PASSION, correspond with the antient</p>

            <p>Heraldry - 'The Hearts of old, says our inimitable SHAKESPEARE, gave HANDS.' - Not that she is affectedly nice respecting his person, years, or exterior qualities: - A young man, she charitably presumes, may be virtuous; a man of middle age, discreet; and if somewhat advanced in life, she would hope to profit herself by his wisdom and experience: - 'Tis a MIND she seeks, more than a MAN; and a chaste COMPANION she wants, more than a HUSBAND. - Letters directed to, &amp;c.</p> <p>A fool at any age might be hooked by such a bait.</p> <p>An infamous sharper  - and a tradesman upon the brink of destruction - (the one urging his insuperable modesty, as</p>

            <p>an apology for his mode of application - the other pleasing the immensity of his affairs, which will not afford him time to go through the usual formalities of wooing) - make shift to draw in a couple of simple girls, to their utter ruin, and disquiet and disgrace of their families! - 'But such calamities,' said the ill-starred brides, 'being destined to us by the over-ruling powers, were not be avoided!' - 'My spark!' (meaning the sharper) said one of the young ladies, 'was foretold me in a dream, three nights before I read his advertisement; which only brought it fresh to my memory!' - 'And my gentleman,' said the other, ' I married out of a frolic! - it seemed to me such a handy way of getting</p>

            <p>a husband! - and, you know, I was always a mad, unaccountable girl!'</p> <p>Some gentlemen publickly avow their preference of concubinage, to the matrimonial tie - and make such proposals, as are not likely to pass unregarded: - Some ladies, voluntarily offer themselves to go into keeping.</p> <p>Frequent and various courtships are carried on by advertisements - Love-assignations are too common to be insisted upon.</p> <p>Unmarried ladies, who have been so unfortunate as to sprain their ankles, or to acquire dropsical habits; may have</p>

            <p>them reduced with the greatest ease and delicacy: - And married ladies, of less frigidity in the absence of their spouses, than dame PENELOPE of old - (after covering their shame with long stays, and long aprons, as long - as they possibly can be concealed) - may lie in privately - and be treated with the utmost tenderness and consideration - and their brats be provided for, somehow or somehow - so as never to give them any further concern.</p> <p>I have often conceited the possibility of carrying on INFERNAL CORRESPONDENCE, and conspiracies of the most treasonable and damnable cast, thro' the channels of Newspapers, in anonymous advertisements! - Another POWDER-PLOT!</p>
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i70"/>
            <p> - another FIRE of LONDON! - the seizing upon the TOWER, or the BANK of ENGLAND! - This presumption is by no means strained, if you will vouchsafe it a fair and candid consideration.</p> <p>A knot of villains might easily fix upon a PAROLE, to be so communicated: - or A. B. requesting the favour of C. D. to acquaint E. F. and the rest of the parties concerned, that every thing was now amicably adjusted, and the parchments ready for execution - (or any other rigmarole stuff) - might be inserted to answer the most flagitious purposes. - </p> <p>This is no justifiable manner of transacting lawful business: - No men in their</p>

            <p>There are among us a set of cruel witlings, the disgrace of human kind - for they are wanting in the common feelings of humanity: - a set of wanton wretches, unknown in every other age and country! - How should it be otherwise? - for, indeed, no other age or country ever afforded them the same opportunities: - Such are the authors of paragraphs and advertisements, calculated to amuse, to mislead, and to distract: - But chiefly intended for their own private diversion, and the entertainment of their knots, and parties, and clubs.</p> <p>A virtuous character who has slightly offended one of those wicked wits, will be sure to draw down upon himself the united</p>
            <pb n="71" xml:id="pb-71" facs="#i73"/>
            <p>vengeance of a whole posse: - They will marry him to his maid, or his drynurse; or father a bastard upon him - they will break his neck in a fox-chase, or his circumstances at a gaming-table - they will raise him, by disreputable means, to affluence; or send him waddling out of the alley - they will feed him with a hearty supper over-night, and find him dead in his bed next morning - they will providentially rush in, time enough to hawl him out of his fishpond alive; or leave him, hanging in his garters, in his own hayloft.</p> <p>They invent probable and striking wants, and tempting services, which thousands are capable of and anxious to supply - merely to put people to the expence</p>
            <pb n="72" xml:id="pb-72" facs="#i74"/>
            <p>of advertisements - or to procure letters - many of which may come hereafter to be printed - and, doubtless, will make very genteel miscellanies, according to the present system of printing and reading.</p> <p>They endeavour to make common things, rare; and take in the credulous, by offering handsome premiums, for what is to be found every where: - The story of the tabby cat, by this time, is somewhat stale.</p> <p>They send some people of sleeveless errands from LONDON to YORK - and bring others from YORK to LONDON.</p>
            <pb n="73" xml:id="pb-73" facs="#i75"/>
            <p>A poor labouring man, in a far distant country, seeing, some two years ago, an advertisement, offering a large sum for a Queen ANNE's farthing, luckily bethought himself he was possessed of two! - (wretched casts! as the understanding reader will readily suppose.) - But having no suspicion that a farthing, could be any thing less than a farthing - and finding that, by the greatest good fortune in the world! - two farthings were so much better than a halfpenny, as even to promise a little portion to a poor man! - Off sets the simple peasant, leaving his work and family behind, and begging his way onward to our witty capital! - But who can express the sorrow of the sorely-fatigued and anxious-minded traveller; or be totally insensible to his disappointment?</p>
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i76"/>
            <p> - who, after careful enquiry, but in vain, for the wanton advertiser - was obliged to beg his way back again!</p> <p>They must have sorry hearts, indeed, who can enjoy such jests!</p> <p>Hitherto we have endeavoured to point out some of the most glaring enormities of Newspapers - which we flatter ourselves will appear so self-evident to every rational and understanding reader, that, from the foregoing premises, we may safely conclude - Newswriters, Newsmanagers and Newsprinters can only rank with the lowest, and most worthless of all men who disgrace the press! - for we can have no idea that any man of</p>
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i77"/>
            <p>honour would make a profession of living by conducting, or printing a Modern Newspaper.</p> <p>They must be void of principle - for they make a jest of every principle of virtue! - </p> <p>They must be dissolute - for they decry all order! - </p> <p>Without humanity - for they delight in public calamity and private misfortune! - </p> <p>The declared enemies of their country - for they spread sedition, and scatter discontent in every quarter! - and endeavour, as much as in them lies, to</p>
            <pb n="76" xml:id="pb-76" facs="#i78"/>
            <p>kindle the fire of intestine and foreign war!</p> <p>A word or two concerning proprietors, or part-owners of Newspapers (independent of printers and managers) may not be amiss - as it is well known that almost every paper is the joint-interest and concern of a number of partners - some papers being lotted out into no less than twenty, thirty, forty different shares.</p> <p>To such gentlemen, I shall beg leave to observe - that as he only can be accounted a just man, who advances his fortune by just and honourable means; so also is he universally allowed to be an unjust man, who seeks to profit himself by unjustifiable measures.</p>
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i79"/>
            <p>In that predicament stands every proprietor, or part-owner of a licentious Newspaper: - they make unworthy and unmanly gain, of mischievous and opprobrious merchandize: - They stimulate the worst of men to collect and invent such paragraphs, essays and presumptions, as they know to be improper food for the public - subversive of good order and good government - and many of them false and scandalous: - They know also, that without such wretched materials, their circulation must cease. From whence it is natural to infer, that, with respect to such connexions, they are men of no more virtue, than those who would run shares with BROTHELS and GAMBLING-HOUSES - provided they could be carried on with impunity, and their</p>
            <pb n="78" xml:id="pb-78" facs="#i80"/>
            <p>names remain a secret. - I therefore think it will become every gentleman of character among them, to withdraw his countenance and support of such despicable craft - and to despise every possible advantage which may arise from such lawless, seditious and defamatory publications.</p> <p>There are published per week, of London-News only, including morning and evening posts, gazettes and weekly journals, sixty-six or sixty-seven distinct papers: - There are also about forty printed in different country towns of SOUTH BRITAIN: - The average of impressions per week, cannot fall short of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND! - a sufficient number, we may reasonably conclude,</p>
            <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i81"/>
            <p>to render a restless people, neither more nor less than downright stark-staring Newspaper-mad!</p> <p>And what is this, I pray you, but keeping up a monstrous army of irregulars? - composed of incendiaries, seditious persons, pretended reformers, mischievous politicasters, mock-patriots, brawling detracters, insinuating slanders, professed liars, restless idlers! - to fight against government and the laws?</p> <p>Again, if we multiply the given number by twenty (which is very moderate for the hands and eyes by which each paper is pass) the multiple will be FOUR MILLIONS per week! - Out of so many readers, let any dispassionate man</p>

            <p>judge of the probably mischiefs that may arise - by poisoning the affection, perverting the will, and depraving the understanding of thousand of worthy and well-disposed subjects.</p> <p>I have already excepted the GAZETTE (printed by authority, and therefore out of the question) and the DAILY ADVERTISER - </p> <p>And here I think it but common justice due to Messrs. JENOUR, the printers, part-owners, and publishers of the DAILY ADVERTISER - (the best conducted and most useful paper in the three kingdoms) - to testify my approbation of their public conduct respecting articles of news, amidst the just censure I have thrown out against their brethren.</p>
            <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i83"/>
            <p>I declare I am no proprietor in their paper, nor particularly connected with any who are: - neither do I speak from partiality to those gentlemen, of whom I have but a very slight knowledge: - in proof of which, their candour will pardon me for adding, that in regard to idle and anonymous advertisements, they themselves cannot be too cautious.</p> <p>I shall not take upon me to determine with exactness, the revenue which arises to government, by the iniquitous craft of Newspapers with their advertisements - I judge somewhat about TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS per annum!</p> <p>But was every penny a pound, and every pound a hundred - the sum would be by</p>
            <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i84"/>
            <p>far too inconsiderable - to be obtained at the price of the virtue and allegiance of the people - and the peace and good order of the state!</p> <p>At present, the knaves bid defiance to their rulers! - and daringly trumpet of what consequence they are to the public revenue! - </p> <p>'They exact a price, say they, and we pay it! - what would they have more? - We have no privilege but what we pay for! - They will hardly think of restraining us, while a much greater proportion goes int heir coffers, than comes into our pockets! - And punish us, 'tis plain they cannot - or they dare not - or certainly they would have done</p>

            <p>it long ago! - No, no, we know our masters wants and their weaknesses, as well as they know themselves! - They cannot do without us - and hardly make shift as it is! - Our stamps, let me tell you, make a pretty sum-total at the year's end - there's the mystery, if you must know! - Besides, do you imagine they will ever have the impudence to attack our darling freedom? - the privilege which we have purchased with so much sweat and blood! - and maintained with so much unchastised noise and hubbub! - the MAGNA-CHARTA-LIBERTY of the PRESS! - 'Sblood and thunder! - that would be to strike at the very VITALS and HEART-FAT of LIBERTY!'</p>

            <p>Insolent reasoners! - but enough of the cause - 'tis now time to add a few words touching on the cure, and the probably means to effect it.</p> <p>Men who have no sense of their duty, should be brought to it by some means or other.</p> <p>The method is short and obvious - 'tis as easy as lying! - and happily for us, Administration has the indisputable power in their own hands!</p> <p>They may raise a clamour against the measure - but what of that? - so let them: - So they would, most likely, against any other measure, proposed for the nation's honour and the kingdom's</p>

            <p>safety: - they have raised groundless and unjustifiable clamours enow already - that would be only adding one more to the number.</p> <p>The same power which enables Government to grant, it may be presumed, en-enables Government to withhold: - STAMPS are, unquestionably, the Newsprinters LICENCES - without which they dare not print and publish Newspapers with advertisements - </p> <p>The same wild and preposterous matter, published after any other manner, would fall far short of the mischievous effects produced by the present mode.</p> <p>The public may be wrought upon, in</p>

            <p>some measure, by a wicked book, or a wretched pamphlet - but nothing captivates the vulgar, and the public in general, like a Newspaper - </p> <p>Few read books and pamphlets; but every body reads what passes under the denomination of NEWS: - Books and Pamphlets cost money, and some trouble to procure - Newspapers may be had for nothing, or next kin to't - without any trouble at all.</p> <p>I therefore humbly propose, that the first seditious, malicious and wanton offender, after previous notice given, be refused his Stamps at the Office: - Deny him his Stamps, and his business must stand still: - Distract his business</p>

            <p>In SICKNESS, in PESTILENCE, in FAMINE! - the greater the extremity! - the more dreadful the visitation! - (so says my edition) - the less may you be spared from your duty.</p> <p>We read of one good bishop, in the early ages of christianity (HELIODORUS by name) - who was deprived of his bishopric, as it is said, for writing, or rather for avowing himself to have been the author (for it was written when he was a young man) of a chaste romance.</p> <p>Indeed he ought not to have been deprived, in my opinion - for he was a virtuous man, and made a virtuous book: - In my judgment, he should have kept his book and his bishopric too - </p>
