             <p>DEDICATION.</p> <p>To the POLISH COUNT,</p> <p>JOSEPH DE BORUWLASKI.</p> <p>SIR,</p> <p>THE usual stile of Dedications is that of flattery, attended with selfish views, since the first address of the sort, which, it seems, was produced from the servile pen of indigence, and it plainly appears, that Authors, in the moment of adulation, erect a consequence to themselves; and while they distress the favour of their Mecaenas, or put their Hero to the blush, they sacrifice to their own vanity.</p> <p>At the same time that it must be admitted, that great and distinguished characters command admiration and respect from the public, it cannot be passed over in silence, that the greatest adept in Eulogy would be at a loss to add the least spark of lustre to yours, without derogating</p>
            <pb n="iv" xml:id="pb-iv" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>from it. The eminent talents which adorn themselves in you, not only have gained you admission,  but a candid reception into the principal Courts of Europe; while the graces and virtues look up to you as their darling. Whence arises, that Je-ne-sai-quoi, and complacency of manners, which, like a ray of the sun, beams on those who are so happy as to fall within the sphere of your acquaintance.</p> <p>The Editor of this common place Miscellany is aware, lest, while he attempts to do you justice, he should make an attack upon your feelings, which would be the same as to commit a felo de se on his own. He therefore concludes in the words of the immortal Poet:</p> <p>" - Nay, do not think I flatter,</p> <p>For what advancement may I hope from thee,</p> <p>That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,</p> <p>To feed and cloathe thee."</p> <p>SHAKESPEAR.</p>

             <note>image</note> <p>PREFACE.</p> <p>THIS Fugitive Miscellany of Bon Mots and Anecdotes naturally look up to the public for protection, as the motive of its being compiled was merely to afford Amusement to the Hour of Leisure, Unbend the Brow of Care, and Banish ENNUI.* - It is no small point gained if it has the effect to make the reader smile, which, according to Sterne may add a year to his life.</p> <p>I will not take upon me to determine the nature or origin of WIT. Mr. Pope has defined it to be a clear conception, with an easy delivery. Some have had recourse to the innate principle for its existence, and traced it to the third story of the imagination; others have placed it in a startled trope. Some have reduced it to a system, and have found the Cream of the Jest</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* ENNUI will not admit of a translation, though the French say it is an English Malady.</p>
            <pb n="vi" xml:id="pb-vi" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>where there was nothing but froth at the top, while others have settled it to be a flash from the jarring of discordant ideas, and have pursued it like a Will with the Wisp, or a Jack with the Lanthern; and some again, more groveling, imagine it to be what is vulgarly called Fun, and make it consist in a Pun, a trick of Leger de Main, or a double Entendre; but as Shakspear observes, "How every fool can play upon the word!"</p> <p>WIT seemingly owes its birth to a warm climate, where Apollo presides with the Muses; where Genius arrives at its greatest state of maturity, and is spontaneously produced in Greece; where Athens, the principal seat of learning, was the ancient residence. In modern times it has flourished in Italy, where as their poetry is allowed to be the most sublime, so is their Concetto esteemed to be the most delicate. The French shine in Jeu d'Esprit. Still it may be inferred that mankind have ever been on the same level in respect ot intellect, though it must be allowed that it has worn a different garb, according to the different fashions of the times. In the dark ages we find it hid under a cloud, but when the Augustan approached, It suddenly burst forth like a Meteor into its present refined state, and that our Northern Island is not a stranger to its influence, - I hope the following pages will fully prove.</p>

             <p>M. Menage, a celebrated French Wit, has wrote the following passage: "Oun s'imagine que les Bons Mots ne servent que diverter ils servent encoure a rendre Service." - It is a common notion that Bon Mots serve only to amuse, they are also profitable for instruction.</p> <p>I will not trespass further on my Reader's patience, who already wishes to turn over a new leaf, nor, in the very commencement of my book, will I trangress that brevity, which, according to our great Bard, is the Soul of Wit.</p> <p>"Memoria admodum prompta."

             <p>THE</p> <p>FUGITIVE</p> <p>MISCELLANY</p> <p>OF</p> <p>BON-MOTS, &amp;c.</p> <p>JOHN RAP, of the parish of Burton Agnes, near Bridlington in Yorkshire, was so unkind a husband, so severe a father, so rigid a master, and so bad a neighbour in general, that not a tear was shed at his funeral. The Sexton observed, that he had officiated in that capacity forty five years, and that an instance of the sort had never happened before, and that it might not disgrace the village, seized a little boy and lugged his ears most severely, which soon produced the desired effect.</p>

             <p>Dr. A. Physician at Newcastle, being summoned to a vestry in order to reprimand the sexton for drunkenness; he dwelt so long on the sexton's misconduct, as to raise his choler, so as to draw from him this expression, Sir! I was in hopes you would have treated my failings with more gentleness, or that you would have been the last man alive to appear against me, as I have covered so many blunders of your's!</p> <p>The Rev. Dr. -, Rector of Hurworth, in the county of Durham, preached three Sundays successively upon these words: Behold now the ax is laid to the root of the tree, Matthew iii. 10. It happened that a timber merchant came to the village and inquired at the public house, if the landlord could direct him to a good purchase. The host very gravely recommended him to the parson of the parish, for, says he, he has been felling wood the last three weeks. The unwary traveller believed the information, and waited upon his Reverence. The doctor, astonished at the application, began to remonstrate with the merchant upon his insolence. The man, equally surprised, very coolly gave his authority: when the Rector's wife thus unravelled the mystery: "My dear, I hope</p>

             <p>this will be a warning to you in future, not to preach three Sundays upon one and the same text."</p> <p>A Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, on the eve of his departure from the University, preached at St. Mary's, upon these words, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all, And owing a great sum of money in the town, enlarged mightily on the first part of the text, Have patience, &amp;c. Now, says he, I should come to the second part, and I will pay you all; but having prest too long on your patience, I must leave that till the next opportunity; so pray have patience with me!</p> <p>A Physician travelled in Cambridgeshire, and found the roads so inaccessible around a town, that he repaired to the rector of the parish, and exclaimed, "Ah Sir!" says he, "You may preach long enough, but your parishioners will never mend their ways."</p> <p>A Welch Parson in his discourse told his congregation "how kind and respectful we should be one to another," and said, "that we were even inferior to brutes in that point." He</p>

              <p>brought in an example of two goats, which met one another upon a very narrow bridge, over a river, so that they could not pass by without one thrusting the other off. "Now how do you think did they do? I'll tell you: One laid him down and let the other leap over him. Ah! beloved, let us live like goats."</p> <p>The Rev. Dr. Sherlock, at dinner on a fast day, asked his wife for some butter, "truly, husband," says she "here is as much as you can have, unless you swear, and then I can afford you more." N. B. He was a Non-juror, and would not take the oaths; whence the saying "Enough to make a parson swear."</p> <p>A link boy asked Dr. Burges, the preacher, if he would have a light, "No, child," says the Doctor, "I am one of the lights of the world." "I wish then," replied the boy, "you was hung up at the end of our alley, for we live in a devilish dark one."</p> <p>A fellow, in King James's time, seeing Sir James B. in liquor, spoke this verse extempore:</p> <p>Here lye the subpoena-laws and the test,</p> <p>And here lies Sir J. B. as drunk as a beast.</p>

             <p>His late Majesty, George II. asked Admiral D. what the sea-phrase "keel-hauling" meant.

Cel-e Ber. imi. the distillers, Viri.

It is set apart for the citizens of London.</p> <p>A gentleman was reproached for voting at an election, against his conscience; "the charge is false," said he, "for I never had a conscience."</p> <p>King George II. of glorious memory, commanded at the battle of Dettingen, and his horse ran away with him into the French lines, on which his Majesty alighted, and charged the enemy on foot; "for," said the King, "tho' my horse runs away with me, I am sure my legs will not."</p>

             <p>Miss - the daughter of Mr. -, who drove stage coaches, and reputed a jacobite, happened to be seated in the stage box at the theatre at York; the box was already taken by a Mrs. F. and, on the latter's entrance, some altercation ensued, till Mrs. F. recollecting herself, said, "she could not dispute it with one who had an hereditary Right to the box."</p> <p>Mr. C. dancing at the York Assembly with Miss Bacon; after the dance they sat down in the Love-Corner, so called at the Rooms, when one of the dancers came up and asked C. why he saved himself, and did not stand up; he made answer, "he did not want to save himself, but to save his Bacon."</p> <p>Cardinal Tempe, the Pope's Nuncio at Lisbon, on a visit to a Portuguese Nobleman, repeated often, "Fa Caldo," the Italian phrase, 'tis very hot. The servant mistaking the meaning, carried him a mess of broth. N. B.

He had married three wives and she was his second.</p> <p>There is a sign at a peruke-maker's on the London road; - Absalom handing on a tree,</p>

The Abigail, at a loss for the sense, gave it to the nurse who translated it "He did it and she did it."</p>

             <p>Lady Bridget L. told G. S. (whose penchant is in the extreme for public executions and who always spurs his hobby to tyburn) "She hoped when he paid the debt to nature the thread of his existence might be spun out with the palsy; that he might have the pleasure of seeing one side expire before the other."</p> <p>When the Beau-Monde carried the coteries upon the leads of the houses, and pitched a tent there, it was referred to Geo. S. who not approving of it, said, that it was making too great an encroachment upon the cats.</p> <p>A gentleman asked the master of a ship, from Newfoundland, if he had seen any Rein Deer there; "Alack," said the Captain, who was deaf, "I have seen it rain very hard, but I have never saw it rain Deer."</p> <p>A poor man married an Esquire's daughter. As the rich man would not be reconciled, or give him any portion, he christened all his children by the father-in-law's surname, that they might convey, as beggars, the family name to posterity.</p>

             <p>An English lady asked the Mother Abbess of a Convent at Paris, if the Nuns kept the Vow of Chastity. "Yes," said the Abbess, "I can venture to affirm it. For if it be a crime to cuckold an earthly husband, how much more an heavenly one?"</p> <p>A man of the name of Mark Noble, passing by the Garrison at Hull, the centinel, as usual, called out, "Who comes there?" "Twenty shillings," answered Mark. "That cannot be," said the centinel. "Why, a Mark and a Noble make twenty shillings," says Mark.</p> <p>Two Penitents, in a procession at Lisbon, on Ash-Wednesday, were comparing notes about their sins. One said, "he had lain with his mother," "Ay!" said the other, "but that's a mere peccadillo to my crime, for I laid with my grand mother."</p> <p>A person reading the names of Young Senior and Young Junior, on a shop-bill, said, the first was a contradiction and the second a tautology.</p> <p>Lord Chesterfield, on seeing Lady M. a reputed jacobite, adorned with orange ribbands, at</p>

            <p>During the late Siege of Gibraltar, in the absence of the fleet, and when an attack was daily expected, one dark night a centry, whose post was near the Devil's Tower, and facing the Spanish Lines, was standing at the end of his walk, whistling, looking towards them, his head filled with nothing but fire and sword, miners, breaches, storming, and bloodshed! - By the side of his box stood a deep-neck'd earthen jug, in which was the remainder of his supper, consisting of boiled peas. A large money (of which there are plenty at the top of the rock) encouraged by the man's silence, and allured by the smell of the peas, ventured to the jug, and endeavouring to get at its contents, thrust his head so far into the neck as to be unable to withdraw it: At this instant the soldier turned round and came whistling towards his box, the monkey, unable to get clear of it, started up to run off with the jug sticking on his head. This terrible apparition no sooner saluted the eyes of the centry, than his frantic imagination converted poor pug into a fine blood thirsty Spanish grenadier, with a tremendous high cap on his head; full of this dreadful idea, he instantly fired his piece, roaring out that the enemy had scaled the walls. - The guard took the alarm, the drums were beat, signal</p>

Con. in a new way.</p> <p>A young Officer, a Cornet in a regiment not twenty miles from Chatham, being hospitably entertained by a neighbouring Gentleman Farmer, formed a deliberate plan of seducing his wife. The usual siege was laid, and such assiduity preserved, that it could not escape the eye of the farmer; but, depending on his wife's constancy, he did not forbid the military advances of his constant guest, holding it as a maxim, that a woman who was not proof against the frippery parade of a regimental coxcomb was unworthy the care of a man of sense. In process of time, however, the Lady, who despised the advances of the Captain, and really loved her family, took an opportunity of stating the whole case to her husband: - In consequence of which</p>
            <pb n="245" xml:id="pb-245" facs="#i261"/>
            <p>a plan was laid, and the execution nearly proved fatal to the lover. Mr. B-, the farmer alluded to, invited all the Officers of the regiment to dine with him, on a certain day, except the Captain, and as this was a palpable insult the Captain was not a little rallied, upon the neglect at the Mess Room, where he had often said "He should make the Farmer's wife one of his regimental followers." - It, however, so happened, that on the day previous to the dinner, the Captain received a letter from the Lady, intimating that if he would attend at the garden gate, at half past ten the same night, he should be conducted, by a faithful Abigail, to a much more delicate entertainment than eating and drinking could afford. This happy circumstance the Captain broadly hinted at Sunday's mess, where he said, "They would drink with the husband while he conversed with the wife." - All things were prepared - the Officers dined with the Farmer - and the Captain, true to his appointment, met the Abigail, who conducted him to a closet adjoining her mistress's bed-room, desired him not to say a word, but undress, and enjoy, in the next room, what he sought for; - transported with the idea, and laughing at the fools below stairs, he was soon under the bed-cloathes,</p>
            <pb n="246" xml:id="pb-246" facs="#i262"/>
            <p>and scarcely there before he received such a pressing hug as obliged him to call out for help in tones of loud distress; the alarm was given, - the company ran up stairs with lights, and on entering the chamber found the Captain fast locked in the arms of a great she dancing Bear: The Proprietor of the beast holding the chain of his property on the left hand side of the bedstead, the first business was to release the poor lover from his hugging mistress, which, with the assistance of the keeper, was soon effected, but at the expence of three broken ribs and a violent contusion on the temple, that the bear made with the buckle that muzzled her jaws. The situation of the lover's mind may be conceived, but not described; he got home in a state only to be envied by a man who is just going to be hanged, and unable to bear what he had a right to expect from the mess, has given in his resignation with intent to retire on the half-pay list. The squeezes which he received in this love adventure, have so injured his health, that there are but small hopes of his recovery: The Farmer and the Master of the dancing bear, therefore stand in an awkward predicament, as indictments are lodged against both. This matter was to be hushed</p>

He said he knew I could cure him, and therefore intreated me to give him something, for he was resolved he would go to no body else. I perceived what an opinion he had of me, and that it was only melancholy that troubled him, took it in hand, and warranted him, if he would follow my directions, to cure him in a short time. I desired him to let me alone for about an hour, and then come again, which he was very willing to do. In the mean time I got a card and lapped it up handsome in a piece of taffeta, put strings to the taffeta, and when he came I gave it him to hang about  his neck, charging him that he should not disorder himself neither with eating or drinking,</p>
            <pb n="248" xml:id="pb-248" facs="#i264"/>
            <p>but eat very little supper, and say his prayers duly when he went to bed, and I made no question but he would be well in three or four days; - within that time I went to dinner at his house, and asked him how he did. He said he was much better, but not perfectly well; or, in truth he had not dealt clearly with me. He had four Devils in his Head, and he perceived two of them were done, with that which I had given him, but the other two troubled him still. Well, said I, I am glad two of them are gone, and I make no doubt but to get away the other, so I gave him another thing to hang likewise about his neck. - Three days after he came to me at my chamber, and profest he was as well as ever he was in his life, and thanked me for the great care I had of him. I fearing lest he might relapse into the like distemper, told him that there was none but myself, and one physician more in the whole town, that could cure the Devils in the Head, and that was Dr. Harvey, whom I had prepared, and wished him, if ever he found himself ill in my absence, to go to him, for he could cure his disease as well as myself. - The gentleman lived many years and was never troubled after.</p>

This heap of ruins formed a striking contrast to an inscription, written in large transparent characters, at the entrance of the grove, "Ici lon Danse." - A contrast still more interesting presented itself to the minds of those who remembered the public rejoicings in 1744, for the recovery of Louis XV. on which day one of the prisoners, shut up in the Bastile, fixed to the window of his dungeon a transparent paper, lighted behind by a lamp, on which were these words, "Gaudet et Ipse Dolor." <note>Latin</note></p>

It was then agreed between the master and servant, to make him a proper acknowledgement for his politeness; the servant was accordingly instructed to say, his master was dying, and in a few days after, that he was dead; - the instructions were obeyed, the Undertaker paid his devoirs to the servant, with a present of two guineas, on being informed he was to have the job.

            <p>milk-maid, whose beauty and innocence might have recommended a worse draught, who, while she stroked the udder, indulged no ambitious thoughts of wandering in palaces, formed no plans for destruction of her fellow creatures; - milk, which is drawn from the cow, that useful animal that eats the grass of the field, and supplies us with that which made the greatest part of the food of mankind in the age, which the Poets have agreed to call golden. It is made with an egg, that miracle of nature which the theoretical Burnett has compared to creation. An egg contains within its beautiful smooth surface an unformed mass, which, by incubation of the parent, becomes a regular animal, furnished with bones and sinews, and covered with feathers. - Let us consider, can there be more wanting to complete the Meditation of a Pudding, if more is wanting, more may be found: It contains salt, which keeps the sea from putrefaction - salt, which is made the image of intellectual excellence contributes to the foundation of a pudding.</p> <p>Dr. Schmidt, of the Cathedral of Berlin, wrote a letter to the King of Prussia, couched in the following terms: - "Sire, I acquaint your</p>

            <p>there appeared in her look and mien, a sprightly health, and her eyes had too much vivacity to become the language of complaint which she began to enter into. She seemed sensible of it, and therefore, with down cast looks, said, "Mr. Bickerstaff, you see before you the unhappiest of women, and therefore as you are esteemed by all the world a great civilian, as well as an astrologer, I must desire your advice and assistance in putting me into a method of obtaining a divorce from a marriage, which I know the law will pronounce void." "Madam," said I, "your grievance is of such a nature, that you must be very ingenuous in representing the cause of your complaint, or I cannot give you the satisfaction you desire, "Sir," she answers, "I believe there would be no need of half your skill in the art of divination to guess why a woman would part from her husband." "'Tis true," said I, "but suspicions at what you mean; nay, certainty of it, except you plainly speak it, are no foundation for a formal suit. - She clapped her fan before her face. "My husband," said she, "is no more an husband," - here she burst into tears, - "than one of the Italian singers." "Madam," said I, "the affliction you complain</p>
            <pb n="266" xml:id="pb-266" facs="#i282"/> <p>of is to be redressed by law; but, at the same time, consider what mortifications you are to go through in bringing it into open Court, - how will you be able to bear the impertinent whispers of the people present at the trial - the licentious reflections of the pleaders - and the interpretations that will, in general, be put upon your conduct by all the world. How little will they say could that lady command her passions? Besides, consider that curbing our desires is the greatest glory we can arrive at in this world, and will be most rewarded in the next." She answered, like a prudent matron, "Sir, if you please to remember the office of matrimony, - the first cause of its institution is that of posterity, - therefore, as to the curbing desires, I am willing to undergo any abstinence from food, as you please to enjoin me; but I cannot, with any quiet of mind, live in the neglect of a necessary duty, and an express commandment, increase and multiply." Observing she was learned, and knew so well the duties of life, I turned my arguments rather to dehort her from this public procedure by examples than precepts. "Do but consider, Madam, what crowds of beauteous women live in nunneries, secluded for ever from the sight</p>

            <p>and conversation of men, with all the alacrity of spirit imaginable; they spend their time in heavenly raptures - in constant and frequent devotions - and, at proper hours, in agreeable conversations." "Sir," said she hastily, "tell not me of Papists, or any of their idolatries." "Well then, Madam, consider how many fine ladies live innocently in the eye of the world in this gay town, and at their ease, that all this seems hardly a self-denial." "Mr. Bickerstaff," said she, with some emotion, "you are an excellent casuist, but the last word destroyed your argument; - if it is not self denial, it is not virtue. I presented you with an half guinea, not to have my conscience eased, but to have my fortune told." "Yet, well, Madam," said I, "pray of what age is your husband?" "He is, replied my injured client, "fifty, and I have been his wife fifteen years." "How happened it you never communicated your distress in all this time to your friends and relations?" She answered, "He has been thus but a fortnight." I am the most serious man in the world to look at, and could not forbear laughing out - "Why, Madam, in cases of infirmity, which proceeds only from age, the law gives no remedy."</p>

Le Noir had the box brought him as soon as the hurry of his business was over, when lo! instead of a senatorial periwig he found a dead child. The Wig-Maker was immediately sent for, and seeing the mistake, explained the matter by telling the Magistrate that his wife had been brought to bed two days before, that the child was dead, and that the persons charged to inter the infant had confounded the two boxes, and buried the one that had the wig in it. M. Le Noir laughed very heartily, and had the wig exhumed, and the child consigned to its proper place.</p>
