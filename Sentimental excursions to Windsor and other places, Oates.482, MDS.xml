             <p>TO</p> <p>MR. CHARLES MACKLIN.</p> <p>DEAR SIR,</p> <p>YOU are to consider this Dedication as a grateful return to the warmth of your friendship, a just tribute to the integrity of your heart. - Seven years intimacy have convinced me of both - </p> <p>Exclusive of these motives, I have another - </p> <p>The author of Sir CALLAGHAN O'BRALLAGHAN, merits respect from every Irishman. - That character has been of national service, by being a means of removing, in a great measure, illiberal prejudices which had too long promoted enmity between sister-kingdoms, but are now happily diminished.</p> <p>I am,</p> <p>most sincerely your's,</p> <p>THE AUTHOR.</p>

             <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p> <p>THIS Bagatelle appeared originally in the PUBLIC LEDGER, in detached pieces, most of which were copied from that paper into the MORNING HERALD. - And they having received the approbation of the Public, the writer was induced to collect them into a volume; and as he will pursue the subject in the Ledger, should this volume have success, he will shortly publish another.</p>

             <p>SENTIMENTAL</p> <p>EXCURSIONS.</p> <p>I Read and read, but could not retain a word of what I read. - So many friends flowed in upon me daily to breakfast, and so many friends to carry me out to dine, that to understand the doctrine of descents, the point I was studying, was impossible. I must cut off, said I, the entail of these engagements, and become master of my own time.</p> <p>Returning from the Grecian at one in the morning, I ordered my servants to pack up my cloaths, with a few books; and at six, he, with my portmanteau on his shoulders, and I, with Lord Coke under one arm, (with whom I intended to comment upon old law) and Sir James Burrow (from whom I expected instruction</p>

             <p>in new law) under the other (1), set off for the Windsor stage.</p> <p>The coach was empty, so ordering my man to mount the outside, and going inside myself, after musing a few minutes on the great progress I should make in the art and science of jurisprudence, during the vacation, between Easter and Trinity term, I folded my arms within each other, having first wrapped myself in a large cloak, threw myself along the seat, and wishing farewel to London, to all the pleasures of London and to all its temptations, fell into a profound slumber.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) I do not understand what our journalist here means by his distinction between old and new law; the efficient principles of law are immutable, the co-incidents are the same; therefore modern determinations should coincide with ancient adjudications; otherwise, notwithstanding the co-existence of legal principles which I have proved, somewhere, to be at least coequal with nature itself, judgments upon the same principles would be deficient in co-operation.

             <p>THE HIGHWAYMAN.</p> <p>THIS was in the merry month of May, when the whole animal creation, from the minutest insect the microscope discovers upon the leaf, to the largest beast which grazes int he field, or preys in the forest; when the fowls of the air, from the diminutive humming bird to the eagle of the sun; when the fishes of the sea, from the little sprat to the unwieldy leviathan, pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven, increase and multiply. I say, it was in the month of May, so justly stiled "the mother of love," when nature wears an universal smile, when every plant and tree sprouts forth in bud and blossom, and the whole earth is cloathed in variegated green: being fast asleep in a stage-coach on the road to Windsor, and my imagination having taken an excursion in a dream to visit,</p>
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>to converse with, and to embrace, some dear friends in Ireland, I was disturbed from my sweet vision about five miles from London, by a tremendous voice, from the side of the road, which with reiterated vociferation, roared out, Stop! stop!</p> <p>My hands instinctively slipped into my breeches pocket, and with a motion equally involuntary, drew forth a small purse, containing the small sum of one guinea and a few shillings, to give the highwayman. The coachman at the same instant drew up his horses.</p> <p>If any hero wishes to be informed why I did not rather apply to my pistols - I had none with me, or if I had, I should not have applied to them.</p> <p>Indeed, instead of charging my pistols, which I left hanging up in my chambers, where may they long hang for ornaments, I had prepared the small sum I have before mentioned, and put it into the little purse aforesaid, in case of being stopped; for it has long been my opinion, that if a man considers his</p>

             <p>own interest, in which undoubtedly his peace of mind has an intimate and large share - to part with what he can spare from his absolute necessities, will appear preferable to risquing life for a trifle. It requires no great portion of humanity to conclude, that to deprive a fellow-creature of life, and dispatch his soul in the very act of sin, to "that country from whose bourne no traveller returns," though compatible with earthly justice, must be offensive to eternal mercy. If this assertion be erroneous, how comes it that the act of sacrificing a wretch's life in defence of a paltry sum, always impresses upon the mind of the avenger, a horror which amounts to punishment?</p> <p>As the coach-door opened I put out my hand - here, my honest friend, said I, addressing myself to the highwayman, here, take my money.</p> <p>I received a shot in return for my courtesy - </p> <p>I say a shot - but not a shot from a pistol, nor a shot from a blunderbuss - it was a chain-shot,</p>
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>or a double-headed shot, which you please, discharged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller.</p> <p>The lady mistaking the offer of my hand, which intended to convey my purse to the supposed highwayman, for an offer to assist her into the carriage, seized it with the most good humoured familiarity, and fixing her right foot firm upon the coach-step, raised her body up with a spring of agility, which clearly proved, elasticity was not the least property in her composition.</p> <p>Thus she stood in equilibrium, nodding and smiling a farewel over her left shoulder, to a male friend, the person who had ordered the coach to stop: and taking her seat exactly opposite to me, she waved her hand out of the coach window, to her parting companion - the coachman, with a hoi, hoi, and a crack of his whip, informed his horses of their duty, the horses obeyed, and we drove on.</p>

             <p>THE POCKET HOOP.</p> <p>IT is astonishing, that women will encumber their persons so as to alter the elegant symmetry of the human frame! - The person of a fine woman is the most beautiful edifice in nature! - True beauty consists in simplicity, and the figure of a well-made female always shews to the best advantage when its ornaments are simple - it should never be embellished in the composite order. - From the days of fig-leaves, to the present time, art has only laboured to disguise nature. - </p> <p>History informs us, that Queen Elizabeth was remarkable for the protuberance of the rotunda; and this, say the antiquarians in dress, first introduced the fashion of hoops. But whether this rotunda was a permanent rotunda behind, natural to the make of her Majesty, or a temporary rotunda before,</p>

             <p>arising from a natural cause, authors are silent (1).</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Hoops are of much greater antiquity than our author seems to have a knowledge of. - They were worn by the Greeks and Romans. Queen Elizabeth's hoop was called a farthingal, it gave rise to scandal, but to keep her Majesty in countenance, the whole court assumed big bellies, which soon became the general pink of the mode. This courtly condescension to the Virgin Queen, has nothing particular in it. - When Queen Anne had a lame leg, the women of fashion carried crutch-sticks; and not many years past, the late French King being forced to cut off the fore-top of his hair, on account of a scald-head, not only the nobility and gentry of France, but the nobility and gentry of Great-Britain and Ireland, cropped their upper locks close to the scull. When Henry VIII. in 1521, cut his hair short, all England followed his example. Camer. Oper. Subcisio Cent. 358. - C.C - TT - R - L.</p> <p>The divine writer, Isaiah, describes the Jewish ladies of his time, in an attire so exactly similar to that which distinguishes the modern English ladies of the ton, that one would imagine he was prophesying of their dress. He mentions their stomachers and their towering heads, their curls, their flowing garments, and their crisping-pins. Solomon too, who having the experience of five hundred wives, and fifteen hundred concubines, and of course must have been well acquainted with the influence of the female over the male sex, in his admonitions to youth, cautions them to beware of the rustling of silks, and the creeking of heels, for it leads to - it led Solomon, the wisest of mankind, from the worship of the Almighty God to the sacrifice of idols. - MADAN, D.

             <p>A hoop, says an old writer, is an airy cool dress. - That may be, answers a modern writer, arguing upon the same subject - but how comes it to pass that Queen Elizabeth, who was a virgin Queen, and her maids of honour, who were virgins by virtue of their office, should require more cooling than their grandmothers? Now the question is very easily answered - Queen Elizabeth and her maids of honour were virgins - their grandmothers certainly were not.</p> <p>I suppose, Sir, said my fellow-traveller, we shall breakfast here, as the coach stopped at the Star and Garter at Kew-bridge. - I leaped out, and gave the lady my hand: - she sprung forward, but the treacherous hoop crossing the door of the coach, gave so sudden a jerk to the lady, that as she sprung she fell, and as she fell, of course the hoop became inversed, as you may have seen an umbrella, or parasol, on a windy day - she slipped from under her garments. - Heaven preserve us!</p> <p>I fixed my eyes upon the sign. - It is the Star and Garter, said I to myself, in an under</p>
            <pb n="10" xml:id="pb-10" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>voice, and in the same tone I read the motto - </p> <p>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>I kept my eyes fixed upon the sign, without once attempting to extricate the lady. Had it been the sign of the Gorgon's head, I could not have been more petrified; - but my man, who had now descended from the roof of the coach, having more presence of mind, entered the coach at the opposite door, and taking the lady by the shoulders, gently pulled her backwards, while I smoothed her cloaths, and brought the villainous hoop to its primitive situation.</p> <p>The lady, having adjusted her drapery, came out sideways - </p> <p>I led her into the house, and being shewn into a room - she cursed her hoop in a tone of bitterness infinitely more vindictive than the curse itself - but how could I say Amen? - I considered myself under some obligations to</p>
            <pb n="11" xml:id="pb-11" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>the object of her curses, "so amen stuck in my throat (1)."</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) - Seraglios - Spanish protections. I tell you they are nothing to the English hoop. Confinement stimulates a woman to do that which otherwise would never enter her head - and pray Sir, did you ever hear that a padlock could protect a leathern portmanteau from the plundering hand of a robber? I tell you no woman has her chastity so well fortified, as an English woman of the present day. Who the devil can approach her? In the rear she carries bastions of cork - in front she has crown-works of whalebone - on the right and left flanks and gorgeats, nothing is wanting to compleat the strength of the place but a tenaille in the ditch. - But if the fashion continues, Sir, we shall never be able to carry a point by storm. - True, and therein lies the safety of female chastity, for all approaches must now be carried on by sap, whenever a lady commits faux pas in the day-time - do you mind, in the day-time - she must never more blame her stars, or attempt to excuse the transgression by the suddenness of the attack, as so many preparatory manoeuvres are necessary to the dismantling of the place. </p> <p>Now, the daughter of the old General who was making these wise remarks upon the utility of hoops, was preparing for bed in an adjacent room, and by clapping a hand to each hip, and drawing a slip-knot, overturned every thing her father said - for down came the fortification, with the bastions and the crown-works flap upon the floor. I wish, said the young lady, slipping under the bed-cloaths, my father's wish would succeed. - I wish it was the fashion for every woman to have a tenaille in the ditch. - TOBY.</p>

             <p>It was all my own fault, said the lady; - I should have come out sideways at first. - But the way you attempted to come, Madam, said I, was the most natural. - True, she replied but not the most fortunate; our natural movements seldom are, said I - till this instant I considered hoops as protections from such accidents, replied the lady, but I now perceive they render one's motions very unnatural - so saying, she retired. Breakfast was served in: - the lady returned, divested of her hoop - her dimity jacket fitted her shape exactly - her petticoat hung in folds - an elegant neglegee appearance marked her person - the conscious tint upon her cheek indexed the continuance of her confusion. - We breakfasted, and having ascended the carriage with caution, and taken our seats, without further accident, pursued our journey.</p> <p>Though the air in the month of May is more congenial to the blood, and more invigorating to the constitution of all animals, than the air of any other month in the year;</p>

             <p>yet man, or woman, after long residence in the metropolis, the pores being open, and the muscles being relaxed, by the heat of full theatres, balls, routs, masquerades, ridottos, close rooms, and sea-coal fires, will find the morning breeze of the country too sharp for their unbraced nerves and debilitated joints.</p> <p>This was my case - I perceived my fair companion also shrunk from the acuteness of the biting air, and sought comfortable warmth in closely wrapping round her a pale pink satin cloak, lined with sable fur.</p> <p>I don't know a more pleasing contrast than pink faced with black - and the lining of the lady's cloak formed such a contrast, the black fur with which it was lined, turning over the edge of the pink sattin like a facing or lapel (1).</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Scarlet, faced with black, has been the uniform of the bravest troops; it was worn by Ligonier's horse, who fought with such amazing courage at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and is now worn by - the London Military Association. - ANONYMOUS.</p>

             <p>Perceiving, then, that the lady not only indicated an aguish tremor, but that sleep had shed his drowsy influence upon her lids, which repeatedly dropped their "fringed curtains" over her eyes; - I proposed drawing up the coach-blinds - the lady complied. - </p> <p>We both benefited by the precaution. - </p> <p>The lady soon involuntarily resigned herself to the soft folding arms of sleep, who fixed his leaden seal upon her eyes. - I exercised my mind in meditation.</p> <p>It has been said, that sleep is the emblem of death. The object I looked upon, so far from raising this gloomy idea in me, produced a quite contrary effect. - I thought of nothing but life, and prolongation of life - my thoughts arose from my feelings, my feelings from what I saw - but my feelings were not merely local - life trembled through the current of my blood - dilated my heart - inspired my soul - expanded my thoughts - warmed my imagination to extasy - and, I answer for it, spoke at my eyes.</p>

             <p>A MEDITATION.</p> <p>THE scene at the inn-door, when I innocently gazed up on the Star and Garter, was fresh in my memory. Not an astronomer of them all, from Ptolemy the Egyptian, down to Copernicus the German, and from Copernicus the German, down to Newton the Englishman, had ever so strong a conception of the hirsute constellation, called by star-gazers Berenice's locks, as I had of the sign at Kew-bridge. - Every object was painted upon my imagination in the most lively colours.</p> <p>I recollected the lady's confusion on the unfortunate event of her pocket-hoop - and this recollection produced in my mind an investigation of modesty. - When an Indian was asked how he could go naked, and expose his body to the cold air, he answered, "because I am all face." Now the same answer would</p>
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>have been as pertinent had it related to modesty, instead of feeling; for in those countries, where the inhabitants go perfectly naked, they look upon each other as undisturbed, with as chaste an eye, and unflushed countenance, as if they were all faces. With them every part is equally indifferent as to sight: the less modesty the less feeling; - the less feeling, the less incontinence, in thought, in word, and in deed.</p> <p>The Lacedaemonians were remarkable for virtue, yet possessed very little modesty; and when we compare their customs with the customs of the chearful, happy inhabitants of the southern isles, discovered by Captain Cooke, it appears the Lacedaemonians were perfect masters, and mistresses too, of the celebrated Timiradi dance, practised by the people of both sexes in Otaheite (1). It must be left to the judgment</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1)Plato, after the example of several well instituted republicks, ordained, that the men and women of all ages should divest themselves of their cloathing, and appear perfectly naked; you will see the reason of it in his Gymnastick. The women of Pegu wear no covering below the waist, but a cloath slit</p>
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>of the ladies, whether the daughter of Cato was right in her opinion, that women should take off and reassume their modesty with their garments. It is certain the Roman matron was a patriot, not however of that class of patriots who ornament the present times; she was not influenced by self- but from a regard to posterity. - And where is the woman who has not a regard to posterity? I answer - the woman who is not solely attached to one man, has neither regard for posterity nor for herself, and cannot be a patriot.</p> <p>Thus did I mentally philosophize, till after long meditation, I concluded with a modern voyager (1), who from the contemplation of unpolished people, has drawn this opinion,</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>up before. - The Lacedaemonian women saw daily the Spartan youth perform their exercises naked, and wore sure slight garments themselves, that as they walked discovered their thighs, they being, as Plato says, sufficiently covered with their virtue. - MONTAIGNE.</p> <p>This might perhaps cool the sense of seeing - but how did it affect feeling. - Seeing's believing, but feeling has no fellow. - RAY'S PROVERB.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Forster, who attended Captain Cooke on his second voyage.</p>

            <p>"that modesty and chastity, which have long been supposed to be inherent in the human mind, are local ideas, unknown in the state of nature, and modified according to the various degrees of civilization."</p> <p>Yet when Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, plucked from the tree of knowledge, they saw they were naked, and were ashamed.</p> <p>Oh chastity! thou art a great and shining virtue in civilized states! Thy utility is sufficiently known - but to govern and prevail with thee according to nature, is as difficult as it is easy to do it according to custom. Thou hast nothing, let me tell thee, pure and fair maid, to support thy precepts, but the hoary head, and shrivelled face, of ancient use.</p> <p>And what is to be deduced from this? Why that the fair fabrick of chastity, was erected upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise. But is not chastity in women the same as courage is in men? Is not chastity the very centre of a woman's point of honour? Is not female chastity a castle defended by religion, morality,</p>
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i28"/>
            <p>reason, custom, pride, apprehension, and shame? True, but when nature mutinies within, and love attacks the out-works, this well-defended castle, is no more than - a castle in the air.</p>

            <p>THE EXAMINATION.</p> <p>THE lady slept on. - </p> <p>I could not get a wink of sleep. - </p> <p>The devil take that sign, said I to myself, cursing the Star and Garter at Kew-bridge. Yet why should I curse the Star and Garter! Is it not an insignia, which our most gracious sovereign respects - which the first of our nobility are continually in pursuit of. - And has not the learned Pettingall, who was a master of arts, thus delivered his opinion, after quoting some hundred authorities, in all language, that the Star and Garter are amulets or charms, allegorical symbols of unity; or as Camden and Heylin have it, "a bond of the most inward society, and a badge of unity and concord, to inspire courage and vigour in men;" - and does he not say, what every true man</p>
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i30"/>
            <p>will join with him in saying, hoi soit qui mal y pense, <note>Latin</note> should be rendered, "shame and confusion to him that designs any evil against the wearer, (that is the wearer of the Star and Garter) may all his designs be retorted on the author." But why are the Bench of Bishops excluded from wearing this amulet? Because they have mitres annexed to their Bishopricks, and that amounts to the same thing - and as to the lawyers, why, they have their black patches upon their wigs - and their scarlet patches upon their doctors gowns - and their furs for their judges robes, delectable to the touch.</p> <p>To banish the idea of the sign at Kew-bridge, I examined the lady's face. - Her eyes were shut - here could I ramble through half a dozen pages, expatiating on the beauty of the eye - whether black, hazel, grey, or blue - whether open or closed, whether shaded by a full grown dark brow, or arched over with the smoothness of a mouse-skin. - I never gave a determined preference to any particular colour, only let it not be a jaundiced eye - nor</p>

            <p>a basilisk's eye - I hate both - but I have long thought, that the eye of a woman looks best when on the twinkle; that is, when it is neither open, nor shut, but like the setting sun skirted by a shading cloud, emanates a lambient fire, through the medium of bordering fringe, with which nature has wisely provided it, for the purposes of ornament and protection. - </p> <p>Give me an eye with quivering beams, dancing with irregularity like the reflection of the moon upon agitated water (1)!</p> <p>I was eighteen years of age, when I first discovered, that the perfection of beauty in the eye, or rather the perfect force of the operations of the eye upon the heart, is not to be found, either when the eye is open, or when</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Mr. DE LOUTHERBOURG is under the necessity of acquainting the public, as a duty he owes them, as well as himself, that he has not given his assent to the insertion of the above idea, which is undoubtedly stolen from the moonlight scene in his EIDOPHUSIKON, and is therefore an imposition on the public, and an invasion of his property. - Lisle-street, Leicester-square, April 26, 1781.</p>

            <p>A DESCRIPTION.</p> <p>THE lady slept on - smiled as she slept, and as she smiled she sighed - </p> <p>Health sported upon her cheek, while love, with a most inticing grace, diffused a non-resisting, if not inviting complacency over every feature, and wantoned on her neck. - Her lips smooth, and red as coral, pouted with fulness, and with a glowing ripeness equal to the blush of the wild strawberry, smooth as the sattin'd softness of the nectarine's coat, divided to give emission to her breath, discovering a set of teeth vying with orient pearl. - </p> <p>Her breath! - </p> <p>I sat opposite to her - Her breath fanned me with a fragrance, infinitely more inspiring, not less odoriferous, than the evening zephyr of June, agitating a rose-thicket, stealing its</p>
            <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i34"/>
            <p>sweets (1). - The effect, however, was different; the fanning zephyr would have cooled, but the southern blast that gathers consuming heat from the burning desert of Arabia, could not scorch with more violence than the breath of my fellow-traveller. - </p> <p>All appeared quiet within the peaceful habitation of her bosom, which, gently heaving, preserved uninterrupted calmness, except when a half-suppressed sigh, or short breathing, broke in upon the regular serenity of its motion.</p> <p>She sighed! - but her sighs were not the sighs of sorrow - neither were they the sighs of pain - they were the sighs of sensibility - and I discovered the nature of her sighs, by the gentle agitations of pleasure, which ever preceded their risings, as tender harbingers, or followed them as affectionate attendants. - </p> <p>it is probable the lady was in a dream, if she was, it was a dream of such sensibility,</p> <note>footnote</note> <p> (1) If Mrs. DAWSON looks in her glass she will see an original resembling this picture. - </p>

            <p>she might be said to wake sleeping (1). I drew a divination from her dream. - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Critics may object to this expression, but it is certainly allowable at this time, when the greatest men sleep waking. - </p> <p>I do believe it to be true, that dreams are certain interpreters of our inclinations. - I dream but seldom, and my dreams are generally produced by pleasant thoughts. - MONTAIGNE.</p> <p>It is no wonder if those things, which men think on, have an affection for, and practise when waking, should agitate their minds when they are asleep. - CICERO.</p> <p>An Expostulation with SLEEP.</p> <p>Why dost thou detain me so long from my friends? - Shall I never get free from the cells of delusive imaginations? - Shall I be for another hour dead to sentiment, to the world, and to myself? When am I to walk out of thy yawning palace, and be alive to action and joy once more? - I will be revenged on thee, for I will abhor the name of every thing that sooths and fawns upon me to become thy captive: - detested be the poppy and laudanum; detested be the sparkling liquor that enervates the powers; and thrice detested be the downy bed! - Never more may I become thy prey. - The days of my life are but short, and let them be spent in the improvements of action, and in the service of my country and my friends! - Vain hope! for I feel that I can no longer resist thy soporific vengeance.</p> <p>Thus exclaims, then sinks in silence - L-D N-</p>

            <p>THE WAGGON RUT.</p> <p>THE road was smooth - the coach rolled on - the lady slept - but as she slept, she slipt. - </p> <p>The cushion on which she sat gently gave way - perceiving her in danger of falling, and anxious to prevent it, I placed my feet close to her's. - This precaution immediately transferred the point of gravity from the feet to the knee, and the coach continuing to communicate its motion to the lady, no sooner were her feet stopped, than her knees naturally bent forward. - </p> <p>Determined to support her, I gently slipt forward till our knees met. - </p> <p>For above a mile we rolled along the road foot to foot, knee to knee - the coach continuing to communicate motion to the lady, the lady communicating motion to me - till,</p>

            <p>unfortunately, the road growing rough, the motion increased, and became irregular - I lost my situation - the lady lost her situation of consequence.</p> <p>Still the lady slept - and smiled - and sighed - and slipped, unconscious of her danger; but the coach-wheel slipping into a waggon-rut, I slipt forward, the lady slipt downward, and my Lord Coke, who had lain unnoticed upon the seat, ever since I came into the coach in the morning, slipt down at the same instant with the lady; but luckily reaching the bottom of the carriage first, his lordship broke her fall.</p> <p>I did all in my power to support her, but in vain - though the lady did every thing she could to support herself, and my Lord Coke lent his assistance. - </p> <p>The accident appeared beyond remedy. - So being on my knees, I offered up a hasty, yet warm, sincere ejaculation to the great God of Love, who lending an ear auspicious to my prayer, in about two minutes I was extricated from - no - not extricated from my confusion.</p>

            <p>A REFLECTION.</p> <p>HAVING got out of the rut, and having passed the rough road, which caused the foregoing accident, the coach rolled on smoothly again. - </p> <p>Now there are many travellers who would rail for an hour without intermission against these rough spots, which every man must sometimes meet upon his journey, let him travel what road he will. - Some men meet them on high roads, some men meet them on bye roads. - Some men meet them on mountains. - Some men meet them in vallies. - They interrupt the rich man in his chariot, and the poor man on the humble foot-path way. - Philosophers have met these rough spots upon the summit of the Alps, the virtuosi have met them in the streets of Rome. - Nay, it has been said, that very wise and grave philosophers have met them on the very carpets of </p>
            <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i40"/>
            <p>their libraries. For my part, i meet them here and there, and every where, and where-ever I meet them, whether on high road, or on bye road, on mountain, on valley, or on plain, I make the most of them. Wherever I travel in a carriage, on horse-back, or on foot, I never abuse them. - </p> <p>Thank Heaven! there is a complacency in my disposition, which bids defiance to trifling casualties; and whether the road be rough, or whether the road be smooth, my temper is still the same, and I never quarrel with the road, nor with myself nor with any thing I meet, but go whistling on - I only wish I may never meet these rough spots on Mount AEtna, on Mount Vesuvius, or on nay other burning mount. - I care not how warm the climate is - but Heaven preserve me from volcanos! - I have an implacable aversion to fire! - </p> <p>A road may be considered as an emblem of life, and much instruction may be picked up in very few miles travelling; yet some there are, and men of great name, who have travelled</p>
            <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i41"/>
            <p>to Egypt, and have attained nothing but the height of the Pyramids, or a sketch of the Sphynx, though they have written whole volumes upon what they have seen, and have not seen; - while others have been able to discover a thousand objects, in a space not longer than from London to Highgate, upon which they have exercised all the benignity of philanthropy. - </p> <p>A road, I say, may be considered as an emblem of life. - How various the prospect on the right and on the left! - Sometimes a serene, sometimes a cloudy sky. - How different are the passengers in their size, in their complexion, and in the manner of pursuing their journey? - What innumerable stops from turnpikes! - What a number of cross roads! - How many arrests from accidents! - And how few make for the same resting-place, or pursue one certain constant gait.</p> <p>This now is philosophizing - that is, if to philosophize, be, as has been defined by some philosophize, be, as has been defined by some philosophers, according to Montaigne, to write at random, and play the fool, as the essayist</p>

            <p>THE CONFUSION.</p> <p>THE sun had now risen considerably above the horizon - the kine had returned to their pastures, having paid their milky tribute to the dairy - and the honest hind, whose labour enables the luxuriant and the lazy, to indulge in pleasures, in sensuality and sloth, while he experienced the effects of the first judgment, announced by the divine wisdom against our primitive parents, by earning his bread with the sweat of his brow, softened its rigour with a chearful song, expressive of content.</p> <p>Every object looked sprightly - every object appeared gay - every object wore the juvenile dress of summer - every object, animate and inanimate, contributed a share of chearfulness to the scene.</p>
            <pb n="36" xml:id="pb-36" facs="#i44"/>
            <p>The situation in which the lady had discovered herself on waking, had overwhelmed her with confusion. A blush of the deepest dye, far beyond the boasted Tyrian, diffused its colour through her veins, sometimes descending, it spread over her fair bosom, and then, as if exhaled by the fire of her bright eyes, rose to her face, and revelled in a rubid glow.</p> <p>The deep colour did not continue long - it faded by degrees to a rosy tint, but not to a fixed complexion - it sported during the course of our journey, in delicate shades. It was not difficult to discover what the lady felt - it was evident, from the revulsion of her blood, that the soul laboured, and the body languished.</p> <p>If my confusion was not equal to the lady's, nor lasting as the confusion which distressed her, I felt an equal share of irritation. It was my ardent wish to relieve her, if possible, though I stood in need of relief myself. I would have roused my spirits, but they had been so lately dispersed, it was impossible</p>

            <p>to recruit them suddenly - I did all I could to rally them, but in vain. I looked to the lady for assistance - the lady looked from me, as demanding assistance for herself - our nerves thrilled in unison - the vibration was sympathetic - the tremor was reciprocal - so had been the cause.</p> <p>I looked again towards the lady, taking her at the same instant by the hand - the vital spirits began to revive from the lethargy they had lately sunk into - the lady's hand lay in mine, a gentle mutual compressure gave my spirits the first alarm.</p> <p>As I looked towards the lady, she turned her head round towards me, just so much as to give the profile of her face. A gentle sigh, with a soliciting cast of the eye informed me, she expected relief at my hands. My heart felt the full force and propriety of the expectation - it almost amounted to reproach. But how should I relieve her? My ideas were astray, my tongue was tied, and could as well have answered calmly from the rack, to the interrogatories of a persecuting Spanish inquisitor,</p>

            <p>being now relieved from embarrassment by the lady's having opened the conversation, I wished the seaman had lost his head instead of his arm - just as my peevish temper suggested the inhuman thought, the poor fellow, addressing himself to the lady, and turning from me, said, Madam, I have lost my arm in the service of my country - and he held up his stump.</p> <p>This man, who had faced the horrors of war undaunted, this man who had faced death in a thousand different shapes undismayed, was scared by the inhospitable, the ungracious and forbidding look, vexation had thrown into my countenance.</p> <p>I was preparing to recompense the injury I intended him, by my wish, which was now retorted with full force upon myself, by giving him the silver I had put into the purse I had prepared for the highwayman - but as I drew the purse from my pocket, AVARICE whispered in my ear, he has Greenwich to support him, or if not, he has his parish to maintain him.

            <p>I had the purse half up, when VANITY stepping in with her advice, and aiding the solicitations of CHARITY, induced me to draw it to the very edge of my pocket. - A few acts of generosity, said VANITY, prudently managed, will give you as much reputation for goodness as most men desire.</p> <p>Shall I, said I to myself - shall I restrain the stream of charity that overflows my heart? Shall I retain, for the purpose of some selfish gratification, this trash, taking the few shillings out of the purse; this trash, which divine bounty designed for the common benefit of all mankind. - The opportunities and inducements we have to alleviate the miseries, and promote the happiness of our fellow-creatures, are innumerable. Our hearts incline us to good, our reason approves the acts of humanity. - </p> <p>All we have is given to us - all we do is but ministering.</p> <p>A fat prebendary, well-mounted, and attended by two servants in livery, came ambling up, all in fine order - no determining which</p>

            <pb n="43" xml:id="pb-43" facs="#i51"/>
            <p>What were the fat prebendary's servants! - Christians!

            <p>almost unknown to myself - in truth, VANITY had nothing to say to the gift, it was the gift of an impulse, involuntarily springing from the noble motive of compassion, which the example set me by the serjeant, had instantaneously kindled in my breast. - </p> <p>The lady also felt the force of the serjeant's damn, and contributed under its impulse to the seaman's wants.</p> <p>I insert this damn of the serjeant, as a precept for the edification of a certain bench, and all those who derive authority under them - but they want not precept - it is in practice they are deficient. - Do as I say, is the great foundation of their preaching. - Why can they not preach, do as I do?</p> <p>Come forth your Grace with your Dutchess - come forth each Marquis with his Marchioness - come forth each Earl with his Countess - come forth each Baron with his Baroness - step forth ye Knights with your Ladies - and hear how the serjeant d-n'd the seman's eyes. - He had experienced himself what suffering is, and could not overlook it</p>

            <p>THE PROPOSAL.</p> <p>THE human mind shoul dever be employed, mental exercise and industry being as essential to the health of the soul, as corporeal exercise and labour is to the health of the body. Idleness in the mind produces vice, idleness in the body produces disease. The vacant hours of dulness are the most dangerous hours of life, for when ever the tempter of mankind, who is always on the watch, finds the mind out of employment, he never fails to step in, with one or other vicious incitement to seduce the soul from virtue.</p> <p>For this reason  I have established as a rule in the mental code by which I govern myself, that when ever I find my mind inadequate to the exercises of study or rational contemplation, which is too often the case, to seek immediate employment for my ideas in some innocent amusement.</p>
            <pb n="47" xml:id="pb-47" facs="#i55"/>
            <p>It is certainly the most probable way of avoiding the devil and all his works.</p> <p>I never stood in greater necessity for the application of my rule than at the present instant. - Was my life to pay the forfeit, I could not enter into a serious conversation with the lady, or a proper conversation with myself; so finding it impossible to speak, and dreading the consequence of thinking, I resolved to disappoint Old Nick by proposing an amusement.</p> <p>I asked the lady to play travelling picquet.</p>
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i56"/>
            <p>TRAVELLING PICQUET.</p> <p>THE lady declared she was totally ignorant of the game. - </p> <p>I once played the game, said I, when Fortune being in a good-natured mood, as she was this day, introduced me to a tete Ã  tete party with a young widow whom I met at Holy-head, and travelled with in a post coach to Chester. - </p> <p>Then, said the lady, you are but a novice at the game yourself?</p> <p>No, Madam, answered I, the young widow was experienced in it, and by her instructions, and playing it repeatedly since, I am now a perfect adept at the game, - and if you give permission, will instruct you. - </p> <p>The lady, bowing, smiled assent to play, and I commenced my lesson.</p>
            <pb n="49" xml:id="pb-49" facs="#i57"/>
            <p>THE LESSON.</p> <p>SUPPOSE, Madam, said I, addressing myself to the lady, suppose, Madam, you and I, - or suppose, Madam, you and any other companion, were travelling in a coach, post-chaise, or vis Ã  vis. - A vis Ã  vis! exclaimed the lady, to ride in a vis Ã  vis, is the height of my ambition. - </p> <p>A vis Ã  vis, Madam said I, is the most convenient carriage for playing travelling picquet in, twenty to one. - I proceeded in my instructions.</p> <p>Suppose, Madam, you and I travel together in a carriage. - We are travelling together, observed the lady. - Well, Madam, you and I travelling together in a carriage, I reckon two for every gate I see on the right hand side of the road, you reckon two for every gate you see on the left hand side of the road, and</p>
            <pb n="50" xml:id="pb-50" facs="#i58"/>
            <p>so according to agreement, a certain number is reckoned for every object seen by you, on your side of the road, or seen by me, on my side of the road, whether man or woman, horse or mare, bull or cow, ram or ewe, cock or hen, &amp;c. - </p> <p>You understand me, Madam? said I, - </p> <p>Perfectly, answered the lady. - </p> <p>But observe, Madam - A man and woman - a horse and mare - a bull and cow - a ram and ewe - a cock and hen, - Et caetera, said the lady, interrupting my recapitulation - I went on - A man and woman, &amp; caetera, Madam, may chance to present themselves on your side of the road, or on my side of the road, so as to entitle you, Madam, or to entitle me, Madam, to a repique.</p> <p>You must explain that, said the lady - </p> <p>Remember, Madam, said I - I don't say man or woman, horse or mare, &amp;c. - but man and woman, horse and mare, &amp;c.</p> <p>Your reason, Sir, for the distinction? said the lady - </p>

The lady hummed on. - </p> <p>If you don't understand it, Madam, the fault is not with you, nor with me, nor with the bishop of London, nor with the other</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) It has been a rule of court not to receive living authorities in the King's-bench, neither Sir Wm.

            <p>THE REPIQUE.</p> <p>THE prospect on my side being beautiful, naturally drew the lady's eyes that way to view it. We were admiring the landscape, when a country lad and lass, who appeared fatigued with the labour of the morning, for the lass walked leaning upon the lad's arm, having arrived at the shady side of a hillock, sat down - </p> <p>I reckoned four to my game. - </p> <p>The lad gave the lass a kiss -by the rule of the game I was entitled to reckon two more. - </p> <p>He kissed her again - again - and again - I foresaw the game would be my own - Encore, said I - </p> <p>Devil take the impudent fellow, said the lady, peevishly, at the same time suppressing a half smile, I shall certainly lose. - But the lass, Madam, said I, appears as much my friend as the lad. - </p>

            <p>She is a Methodist, perhaps, answered the lady, and has been instructed in the doctrine of non resistance - </p> <p>And he is probably of the same profession, replied I, for if I am not mistaken, there will be a love feast presently. - The lad gave the lass another kiss, to illustrate my supposition - I reckoned two more - The lady bit her under lip. - </p> <p>That, Madam, said I, is a point - The lady hummed and looked down - </p> <p>And * * * * * that, Madam, continued I, pointing with my fore-finger thus â - <note>manicule</note>is a quint - The lady looked up - looked forward, then looked up again, as if to look for something in the sky, and overlook every thing on the ground - she then looked down and played with her apron string. - </p> <p>The lass on the hillock side, was also looking at the sky. - </p> <p>You will certainly lose, Madam - I believe I shall lose, said the lady, tying and untying her apron string. - </p>

His precepts affect me like wine, they make my heart glad, - they affect me like love, or rather they affect me like a conjunction of love and wine, for they make me generous and gay.

The stile of STERNE is peculiar to himself, his art is to please the imagination and improve the mind, with natural, yet elegant simplicity. He is master of that charming enthusiasm inspired by heaven itself for the instruction of its creatures: and in his composition there is a certain incommunicable art of making one part rise gracefully out of another, which is felt by all, though seen only by the critic (2).

But I find it impossible to conceive (though I have called in my husband's aid to my assistance) the following assertion. - "Locke, Hume, and many other celebrated authors have favoured us with essays on education, but in ARABELLA they live;" now as Locke and Hume are indubitably dead, and we have not heard of their resurrection, how comes it that they live in Arabella; indeed were they alive, it is out of nature to suppose they should live so long in Arabella; for though Jonas lived a considerable time in the whale's belly, his lie was preserved by miracle, and he was but one person; whereas it appears, that Arabella is ensient, that is, big with Locke, Hume, and several other authors. It is true, a certain dutchess of Heidleberg had three hundred and sixty-five children at a birth; and the font in which they were christened, is still shewn in the great church of the town; but then these were children, not me.

            <p>this inclination, for gaining an intimate knowledge of the lady, and the lady's affairs, than I flattered myself, that the lady felt as ardent an inclination, to be intimately acquainted with me, with every thing about me, and with my affairs. - I not only wished to know her, but to know all her connections. - I asked myself a thousand questions about her, without putting one question to her. - </p> <p>Who is she?</p> <p>Whence came she?</p> <p>Who is her father?</p> <p>Who is her mother?</p> <p>Who are her brothers?</p> <p>Who are her sisters?</p> <p>Has she any brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, or cousins?</p> <p>These questions I put deliberately to myself, stringing them together in succession, as the facetious Sancho Panza, the laugh-and-be-fat-sub-hero of Don Quixote's adventures, strung his proverbs. - But no sooner had I finished my interrogatories upon her relations,</p>

            <p>The lady blushed, but silently assented to my opinion, which she illustrated by a sentimental gentle squeeze of the hand - I thanked her for the compliment, by returning the squeeze in the same sentimental gentle manner I had received it; and raising her hand to my lips, "she nothing loath," kissed it with the genuine fervour of affection and sincerity. - The lady recovered her spirits, and the whole force of those spirits starting into her eyes, her bosom heaving with a heart-easing sigh; alas! said she, with an amiable frankness, I must acknowledge the propriety of your observation. - LOVE IS THE CHILD OF NATURE! But I must sincerely regret, that mere accident has convinced me of this truth. - How happy should I have been, if a long acquaintance, matured into friendship and a series of reciprocal obligations, had been the means of my conviction - how happy should I have been, if it had been my fortune to have loved from the result of judgment, not from the effect of contingency, and she wept. - </p>

            <p>A QUESTION ANSWERED.</p> <p>QUESTION - What is LOVE? - </p> <p>ANSWER. - Love is a desire of contracting friendship, of uniting with, and communicating happiness to a beautiful object; every eye making its own beauty. - Love is active, eager, sharp, precipitate. - Love is fickle, moving, and inconstant; love is a fever, subject to intermissions and paroxysms - But give me that love, which when the paroxysms have subsided, retains an universal fire (1), but temperate and equal, a constant established heat, all easy and smooth, without poignancy or roughness.</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Those who intend to try my celestial beds, may be assured, that the consequence will be, that after experiencing the paroxysms of pleasure, they will also experience an universal fire, electrifying their whole frame, as an emblem of which, I have placed Mercury over my temple. - GRAHAM, D. M.</p>

            <p>Yet love is a tyrant! - All passions are tyrants, but love is the greatest tyrant of all the passions; for love holds all the other passions under arbitrary subjection - love leads every man by the nose (1) - love makes the miser soften the rigour of his avarice (2) - lessens the appetite of the glutton (3) - flakes the thirst of the drunkard (4) - sooths the anger of the revengeful (5) - inspires the coward with courage (6) and - subdues the pride of the haughty (7).</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) The word NOSE, as it stands here, should not have been italicked, but should have been written in the old ROMAN or old IRISH characters.

            <p>THE OVERSIGHT.</p> <p>WAS there ever such an oversight! - was there ever such a fool as I have been, to let her depart without enquiring her name - perhaps I may never see - perhaps I may never hear of her more - prudence, on reflection, may induce her to conceal herself. - </p> <p>I rung for my servant, asked him the lady's name, but to enquire the lady's name had never entered into his head, no more than it had entered into mine. - I eased my chagrin, by severely reproving his negligence, though my uneasiness was the result of my own stupidity. - </p> <p>My servant had spirit, and I had always indulged him in a free exercise of it - he retaliated my reproof, by telling me he had no orders to enquire after the name of the lady;</p>

            <p>and I perceive them now, exclaimed Mrs. Alterman Haileye - but as I am a true woman, I see nothing monstrous about them. - It is a natural appearance, said Johnny. - </p> <p>I am now convinced they must be swans, said Miss, taking another peep, and young ones too, for see, Mamma, they have not moulted off their black down. - </p> <p>If they be cygnets, said my Lord Praetor, we must mark them - his Lordship looked out - </p> <p>I am surprized, said my Lord Praetor, assuming a wise and consequential grin, - I am surprized, that ladies, who are no chickens, and have experience, should make such mistakes - I thought you knew things better, my dear - I can't blame the child (1), but in</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>)1) Though I called my daughter a child on this occasion, yet she was full marriageable, and a rich neighbour had offered his son to her; but I answered, "Sir, I like your son well enough, but we, that is, our family, don't want cash, do you see me, but to mend the blood" - my neighbour was affronted, and so said he, "mend your blood - damn your blood;" and so, do you see me, he went away, leaving me in a horrid state of temerity. - B.

            <p>THE</p> <p>BATTLE OF STAINES.</p> <p>WERE I a poet, I would now invoke a muse of fire to describe a battle upon the water - The battle of all battles should be the BATTLE OF STAINES.</p> <p>A boat, with men attendants, was dispatched by my Lord Praetor, to take into custody the two naked delinquents - but no sooner was the boat dispatched, than a doubt arose about the possibility of griping them. - The doubt was started by Lady Praetor, who said, addressing herself to Mrs. Alderman Haileye, if they overtake these naked wretches, how will they hold them? - Hold them, said Mrs. Alderman Haileye, they must hold them by the hair, it was the only means Adam had</p>

            <p>to hold Eve, or Eve had to hold Adam, before their fall in Paradise, said Johnny. - </p> <p>But that cannot be done here, said Lady Praetor, for their heads are both shaved as bald as coots. - Their heads are shaved said Miss. - There is no more hair upon their heads, than upon my daughter's upper lip, said Lord Praetor. - </p> <p>Miss Praetor hummed, and stroaked her upper lip with her fore-finger. - </p> <p>They must hold them where and how they can, said Mrs. Alderman Haileye; for my part, it is what I would do, were I on the party. - Pray, Mamma, said Miss, pointing with her finger, as if to illustrate her interrogatory - what part would you take hold of? - </p> <p>A dead pause ensued - </p> <p>The boat pursued the men - the men swam from the boat - but the boat could not over-take the men - so the women were disappointed.</p> <p>The men took refuge under the bridge of Staines. - </p> <p>The people of Staines saw the pursuit - they considered the matter as a common</p>

            <p>cause. - The women of Staines were melted into compassion by the danger in which they saw the naked men - they saw every thing, and they felt for every thing they saw. - In short, the men, women, and children of Staines, let fly all kinds of missive weapons upon the deputies of my Lord Praetor. - </p> <p>Alderman Swindle (1) standing upon the poop of the city barge, saw the danger which threatened Lord Praetor's delegates - shall I! exclaimed Alderman Swindle, shall I, who saw prisons burned, and houses consumed, stand an idle spectator, while defiance is thrown in the teeth of Lord Praetor's orders? - I will fly to the bridge of Staines, vociferated Alderman Swindle, and seizing a punt that</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) In consequence of the great courage and manoeuvre shewn by me this day, and my unparalleled condust on sundry other occasions, the Common Council have exempted me from serving in future on any committee, or in any city office; and such is their respect for me, that for some time past they have made it a point to let me eat, drink, and walk by myself; and in conversation none of them ever presumes to answer me. - SWINDLE, Ald.</p>

            <p>DINNER.</p> <p>I Had scarce finished Mr. Squib's account of the battle of Staines, when dinner was served in. - I sat down to eat, but had no appetite - and without appetite, the best meat, with the most poignant sauces, are insipid. - In truth, I had no sauce, not even hunger. - I always eat my meat plain, but now, I could not eat my plain meat. - </p> <p>Not being able to eat, I called for drink - I tasted the beer - the beer was stale. I tasted the cyder - the cyder was sour. "Wine," says the Prophet, "makes the heart of man glad;" the text came across me like a cheering ray - I rung the bell, and ordered a bottle of port. - </p> <p>While the waiter was gone for the wine, I recollected, that though he and the rest</p>

            <p>of the family were ignorant of the Lady's name and residence, yet it was probable the Landlord might have some knowledge of her; determining to enquire, I rung again to order him in, but he saved me the trouble of giving orders, by appearing with a bottle of port in his hand. - </p>
            <pb n="127" xml:id="pb-127" facs="#i135"/>
            <p>THE LANDLORD.</p> <p>MINE host was one of those geniuses, who, like MACKLIN'S Sir Pertinax Mac Sycophant, depended more upon bowing than on education and natural abilities, "he would never stand straight in the presence of a guest;" and to the pliability of Sir Pertinax, he added the complaisance of SHAKESPEARE'S Polonius, being ever of the same opinion with the person he conversed with, unless that person was his wife, or one of his servants; and these he eternally contradicted, whether they were right, or whether they were wrong. - </p> <p>Mine host having made half a dozen obsequious bows, and eyed me from head to foot with the circumspection of a serjeant eying a young recruit, cautiously wiped the dust from the bottle, viewing it at the same time</p>
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i136"/>
            <p>with an expressive look, which fully evinced he would have me understand the wine was old. - </p> <p>It will bear the decanter, said I - I pledge my life upon it, Sir, said mine host, drawing forth the cork with a jerk, attended by a smack from his mouth, accompanied by a smack from the bottle, which not only advertised me of the length of the cork, but of the good opinion which the landlord entertained of his liquor. - </p> <p>There is not better port in the king's cellar, said my landlord, winking (1), filling out a glass and presenting it to me - it is all flavour, like an olive, and is bright as a ruby, said he, holding the glass between his eye and the window.</p> <p>I tasted the port - it was tart - it would not do - the landlord bowed, moving his head in</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) I can take upon me to say, that if the landlord by this expression and wink, meant to insinuate, that his port had ever been in the king's cellar, he was an imposing rascal; for ever since I came to superintend the houshold, I had taken special care, not only of whole bottles and whole joints, but of pieces of bottles and broken victuals. - T-LB-T.</p>

            <p>a manner that I might take either as a polite assent or humble contradiction of my opinion, but at the same time laying his hand upon his breast, swore it was two years in bottle. - I tasted the port again as a complimentary return to his bow, but before I could take the glass from my lips, he assured my honour, that the Prince of Wales had drank of, and approved this very wine. - </p> <p>I felt the full force of the compliment and of the recommendation; the compliment deserved a return, and the recommendation it was not in my power to controvert; so returning "your honour," with a nod of approbation, and giving up my taste to the palate of the Prince of Wales, I swallowed what remained in the glass - </p>
            <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i138"/>
            <p>FLATTERY.</p> <p>THE manner in which my landlord has recommended his port, was irresistible, and perhaps had I changed the bottle for another, I should have got worse wine with more bows, and an assurance, that his majesty had drank a bottle from the same bin - there would have been no withstanding the force of royal authority (1); but growing impatient to enquire after my fair fellow-traveller, my honour condescended to ask my landlord to take a glass, which, after half a dozen bows, he accepted - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) It is astonishing what an influence royal authority has upon the human mind - I do not mean in politics, though heaven knows we have quacks enough in both houses, pretending to administer medicines to the consumptive constitution of the state - but I mean its operation in favour of the slow poisons which are daily administered by quack doctors, and which have no virtue but what they derive from the use of the King's-arms. - ANONYMOUS.</p>
            <pb n="131" xml:id="pb-131" facs="#i139"/>
            <p> - Yet, by heaven, the wine was sour, but FLATTERY took off its tartness - and no wonder flattery should vitiate the taste, when we know its baneful effects upon all the other senses. - Where is there a philosopher, however cynical, who cannot, through some medium, be approached by flattery's honied influence? Flattery is the touch that proves the value and purity of the understanding - </p> <p>Gold tries the integrity of the heart - flattery the strength of the brain - </p> <p>Where is the king who can withstand, or when was there a king who could withstand, unmoved, the adulating baseness of the flattering vermin tribe? The best monarchs have been undone by such miscreants, they have converted the worst into devils - </p>

            <p>DETRACTION.</p> <p>MY landlord being seated, and I having described my fellow-traveller to him as minutely as possible, expatiating upon her perfections as I touched upon them, that is, such of her perfections as distinguished her from the rest of her sex, for there are perfections common to them all - I say, having minutely described my fellow-traveller to my landlord, he run over a catalogue of the beauties of Windsor and the adjacent country; which he had at his tongue's end, with a most surprizing flow of volubility, accuracy of description, point of sarcasm, and now and then, the sweetness of eulogium. - </p> <p>If it was not for her black hair, said my landlord, I should be positive she was Miss A-.</p>

            <pb n="136" xml:id="pb-136" facs="#i144"/>
            <p>for so much a head, they eat as if it was the last meal they had to devour, and scarcely drink sufficient to wash the food down their throats. - Alas, Sir, I have had very few good companies in the drinking way, since the last general election; and those who drank then, drank at the expence of the candidates - </p> <p>And what was your opinion, on that election, said I - </p> <p>Opinion - O, your honour, I never formed any opinion on it - a man who depends upon the custom of the public, should never have an opinion of his own. - I am not one of those public-spirited publicans who neglect their own business, to look after the affairs of the state - it is true, I hear a great deal of talk among my guests about the king's friends and opposition - now your king's friends, I take to be those who are friends to themselves - with success - and opposition, I take to be those who have been friends to themselves - without success - there ever was, and there ever will be parties, your honour - </p>

            <p>ELECTIONEERING INTELLIGENCE</p> <p>EXTRAORDINARY.</p> <p>LORD PRAETOR, Lady Praetor, and Miss Praetor, were sitting at table enjoying the sweets of domestic tranquillity, over the remnant of a pint bottle of port, having just swallowed the second-hand fragments of a re-cooked mutton hash, when an attendant entered, and delivered a letter into Lord Praetor's hand.</p> <p>His Lordship looking eagerly upon the seal, gave a sudden start - his eyes stood fixed in their orbits, and those masticators, which but the moment before had co-operated in assaulting the mutton has, regardless of their natural alliance, assaulted each other with reiterated violence.

We will have a post-coach from the Swan with two necks. I will have nothing that has any thing to do with a swan, said my Lady. - We have had enough of swan-hopping already, added Miss. - </p> <p>Then, my dear, said Lord Praetor, we will have a carriage from the Bell and Savage,</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>better than I did; and if his Grace my neighbour had not paid high, I should never have left my tavern, which his Grace thought a nuisance, to turn Vine-merchant. - O I wish I may become the bar of the King's-bench, where next term I am to receive sentence, as well as I became the bar of the star and garter. - B.

Mamma, said Miss Praetor, joining in the conversation, with a smile ineffable - well now! though I acknowledge long-tails carry the belle in the city, yet for a country excursion give me cock-tails against the globe. - Cock-tails are the very thing, Mamma - indeed they are all the ton, nothing but cock-tails go down in the vis Ã  vis line at the west end of the town. - </p> <p>I will yet have a phiz Ã  vee, said Lady Praetor - but consider, my dear, continued her Ladyship, we are going on business that requires solemnity and procession, and the long-tails are best at slow going. - </p> <p>True, Mamma, replied Miss, but then the pesent business requires expedition, and in a quick trot or canter, the cock-tails have every advantage. - But, my dear, the flowing manes</p>

            <p>THE MESSAGE.</p> <p>I HAD scarcely laid down the LEDGER, when my servant entered the room - his mouth extended to the dimension of a countertenor choirister's mouth, when vociferating "O thou that bringeth glad tidings to Sion." - He bounced in sans ceremony, and rubbing the palms of his hand together with a quickness and zeal that intimated good news and satisfaction, told me he had found the Lady. - </p> <p>And where is she, and what is her name? said I, leaping from my chair with the utmost eagerness. - I cannot say, Sir, answered my servant, where the Lady is, or who the Lady is, but a boy waits to deliver a letter to the Gentleman who came down in the stage, he says it is from a Lady - and as I came down an outside passenger, it cannot be for me - and as</p>

            <p>you, Sir, were the only gentlemen, inside passenger, I conclude it must be for you. - </p> <p>I ordered the boy to be called in. - </p> <p>he was a lad about fourteen, in a neat frock livery. - I have a letter, Sir, said the boy, without a direction, but my Mistress has ordered me to deliver it to the Gentleman who came to Windsor this day in the stage. - I held out my hand for the letter, tore it open, and read - </p> <p>"I impute your omitting to enquire after my name, to emotions similar to those which agitated my bosom at the minute of our departure, and I suppose you have been travelling over the whole town to find me out." - It is what I should have been doing, said I, stamping and cursing my remissness and stupidity - "if a more serious engagement does not call for your attendance, I shall hope for your company as soon after you receive this as convenient; and you must conduct yourself before those you will see with me, as an old acquaintance." - MARIA.</p>
            <pb n="156" xml:id="pb-156" facs="#i164"/>
            <p>My respects, said I, to your Mistress, slipping a trifle into the boy's hand - I shall wait upon her immediately. - The boy retired.</p> <p>In about ten minutes I was dressed. - These ten minutes appeared an hour. - In twenty minutes was at the house. - Never did necessitous tradesman, going humbly to petition a privileged great man, to pay a small debt of long standing, feel a more general agitation of nerves, or knock with a more trembling hand, than I felt, and than I knocked with, at the door of Maria's lodgings.</p>

            <p>THE MEETING.</p> <p>TURNING my head aside accidentally, as I knocked at the door, I saw Maria peep over the window-blind; but when shewed into the parlour, I found her sitting with her back turned towards the door, a book in her hand, supporting herself by her elbow, which rested on the arm of the chair. She was seemingly so lost in meditation, that had I not seen her peep over the parlour-blind, I should have thought she had neither heard me coming in, nor had seen me when I was in. - I gave a loud hem - the boy announced my entrance - "the Gentleman, Madam," and he withdrew. - </p> <p>Maria started from her seat as roused from a reverie. - I should have suspected her of duplicity, but the crimson glow that flushed in her cheek, convinced me that the pretended</p>
            <pb n="158" xml:id="pb-158" facs="#i166"/>
            <p>reverie was not a manoeuvre of experience or practised art, but an immediate consequence of amiable confusion. - </p> <p>The moment our eyes met, I perceived and felt for Maria's situation. - Suspicion fled, and the ardour of passion which succeeded, was instantly checked by the interposition of sentiment. - My eyes bent down-wards - the confusion which revelled in her cheek had raised a tumult within her bosom. - Our feelings were mutual - our hands, guided by instinctive attraction, joined imperceptibly, till a reciprocal gentle pressure convinced us of their junction. - Passion stepped in again, but sentiment still kept her post - we sighed at one instant, as with one breath - at one instant we received relief - yet to speak was impossible - though Maria's eyes expressed unutterable things - mine perhaps were not without expression - at least Maria has since told me so. - </p> <p>I had always an aversion to punctilio - no man in the world understands less, or pays less attention to those who practice ettiquette</p>

            <p>than I do - but ceremony in the present instance was out of the question. Nature pre-dominated, and under her sweet influence I led the Lady to her chair, placed her on it, and placing myself upon another chair close by her, without uttering a single compliment, or a single bow or courtsey being passed on my part or her's. - </p> <p>I led her to her chair, "Grace was in all her steps." Grace, which the VESTRIS could never teach, nor nobility could never learn - for it is neither to be taught nor learned - it was the grace of Nature (1). - It was such grace as her Grace the Dutchess of D- nor her Grace the Dutchess of R- never</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) If you were to see my little memorandum book, you would acknowledge, notwithstanding the above insinuation, that I taught several ladies the true natural grace, and have received large emoluments for teaching the same; but the contents of this little book I shall keep secret, till safe upon the continent, when I shall publish it, as a grateful return for all favours received from the ladies of Great-Britain; and that my gratitude may not hereafter be called in question, I have added to my catalogue many favours which I never received, but which shall also be published. - THE VESTRIS.</p>

            <p>TRISTRAM SHANDY.</p> <p>HAD Sterne, Madam, said I, as I opened the book - Had Sterne experienced such a tender meeting as the present, he could have written a whole volume upon the text. -</p> <p>I was considering, answered Maria, when you came in, what a pity it was that Sterne left the description of the Widow Wadman's person and beauty to the imagination of his reader, and had not drawn the Lady's picture himself. - Alas! Madam, said I, had Sterne drawn the widow's picture, it would only have increased his enemies, and heaven knows, the benignity of his heart and simplicity of his manners, had raised enough of them. - His description, Madam, would have pleased few but himself; the critics would have fallen foul upon it, would have dissected it to a hair, have tortured it limb by limb,</p>

            <p>bedaubed it and besmutted it, for in the article of beauty, we seldom find two men who think alike; some admire slender, some admire full waists (1); a tint in the complexion, or a shade in the colour of the eye, settles the admiration, and gives birth to passion.</p> <p>It is the same with women, answered Maria, they are equally capricious in their likings and affections. - Some women like tall men - others like middle-sized, and some like short men. - </p> <p>Being short myself, I made a low bow - </p> <p>Your observation, Madam, said I, is just, an inch this way <note>vertical straight line</note> - or an inch that way <note>curved line</note> - may gain or lose the affections of a woman - and as to the affections of men, they are not</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) One of the first personages in this country indulging with me in the amorous dalliance of a retired tete Ã  tete, gave me his opinion upon this subject; he declared his dislike to the antiquated figures of former days, described by Pope, "small by degrees, and beautifully less;" exclaiming at the same time in rapture - give me quantity - I despise quality! give me latitude and longitude in love! - </p> <p>ARMSTEAD, spinster.</p>

Sir, it is too true, that the devastation in the gardens of beauty and innocence, are generally made by old wretches. - Her bosom heaved as if bursting - her whole frame was in agitation - I finished the sentence for her - old wretches who lay waste, but cannot enjoy the soil (1).</p> <p>A shower of tears burst from Maria's eyes, and stole down her cheek, I wiped them off - but not with a handkerchief. - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) We have remarked two old fellows of this diabolical cast, who constantly take their evening amusement, during the summer season, in Vauxhall gardens; and who in winter have old haradans in constant pay, priestesses to Satan, at whose shrine they nightly offer up human sacrifices. - </p> <p>F-L-H and H-S-G.</p>

            <p>I could never penetrate into the moral of that dark page, said Maria - </p> <p>I do believe, said I, it is an emblem of the black ingratitude of the world.</p> <p>Then continued Maria, since you do not mean the black, you must mean the marble page; and that page is to me an inexplicable as the other - </p> <p>I do not think, answered I, that there is any great difficulty to unravel the truths which lie mystically hid under the veil of the marble page - I consider it as a true picture of the hard marble heads and hard marble hearts of those envious dull ones, who persecuted him while living; and pray add, said Maria, of those unfeeling dull ones who could not understand or benefit by reading the dictates of his philanthropy - </p> <p>I resumed the subject of the button-hole - </p> <p>Had he filled his chapter upon button-holes, said I, it would have been delectable! - </p> <p>He would have filled it in all probability, observed Maria, but poor fellow, you should</p>

            <p>THE BUTTON-HOLE.</p> <p>A BUTTON-HOLE! - </p> <p>WHAT could Sterne possibly have said upon a button-hole?</p> <p>Would he have entered into its origin?</p> <p>Would he have described it with all its appendages and ornaments?</p> <p>Would he have explained its uses, its shape, and its component parts?</p> <p>Would he have given us all those ideas, which must consequently have arisen before his mind's eye in the course of considering and discussing the subject?</p> <p>Heaven only knows whether he would have done all which these interrogatories enquire, but clear I am, that had he once taken the subject in hand, he would have done his best,</p>
            <pb n="168" xml:id="pb-168" facs="#i176"/>
            <p>and the best can do no more, though the subject to be handled was the best in Christendom (1) - </p> <p>But as I am not endowed with powers natural nor acquired, corporeal nor intellectual, sufficient to support me, should I rashly attempt to enter into so deep and profound a subject, a subject which would baffle the pens of the Royal Society or Sorbonne - a subject, which has exhausted whole folios of learning, and employed the leisure hours of the most learned men. - I will not presume, Madam, to inform you what a button-hole is, though having seen many, and felt more, I will venture to tell you what a button-hole is like. - </p> <p>The button-hole of a pocket being vertical, is like a parenthesis closed thus - â () - </p> <p>The button-hole of the breast being horizontal, is also like a parenthesis, but inversed thus - â <note>horizontal open and close brackets</note></p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) This is the meritricious colouring of eloquence. - TH-RL-W, Cancel.</p>

            <p>better than laymen, I suppose that the button and button-hole, is an ancient as Adam and Eve, and were first used by them in joining their fig-leaves together; for as our first parents had neither needle nor thread, is it possible the use of something like a button and button-hole was discovered by them - </p> <p>And why not a needle and thread, Sir? Might not Adam procure a thorn for Eve, to serve as a needle, and might not Eve give a lock of her hair, to serve as a thread; and this needle and thread being thus procured, it is not possible, or at least probable, that Adam and Eve stitched their fig-leaves together?</p> <p>Whether they buttoned or stitched their fig-leaves together, in my opinion does not signify a farthing - but the learned Hebraists think otherwise (1) - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Several men of extensive learning, have written whole volumes in controverting such essential points of scripture, and frequently preach upon them to the great entertainment of themselves and punishment of their auditors - P-R-Y, D.

Every article of her dress, at least every thing that appeared, was ornamented with needle-work, and though in dishabille, all was neat, and pinned on with a systematic accuracy - </p> <p>This lady was tall and slender, her waist scarce a span, her face forming an accute angle at the chin, her nose prominent, and her skin tight to her cheek-bones, as if braced out of those wrinkles, which a few treacherous gray hairs peeping from under a black wig, informed the beholder it was intitled to - she had but one eye, but then that eye projected so far from out its socket, and had such a convenient power of turning on its swivel (1), that it kept constant guard upon</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Though there is no name mentioned here, yet we are clearly of opinion, that an information will lie in</p>

            <p>TEA-TABLE-CHAT.</p> <p>THE Captain soon discovered I was his countryman, and no sooner made the discovery, than he discharged a volley of interrogatories at me in succession, as quick as a feu de joy - </p> <p>Merciful heaven! Captain, exclaimed Miss Verjuice, a cessation of questions, and let the conversation be general. - Pray, Sir, continued she, turning full upon me, is there any likelihood that the present unnatural war will have a speedy termination - </p> <p>In addition to other qualifications, Miss Verjuice was a politician - </p> <p>Unnatural war, said the Captain, repeating the word unnatural with marked emphasis - Madam, it is not possible that a war by which so many men get their livelihood, can be unnatural - </p>

            <p>Nor the instruments of the war neither, I suppose, replied Miss Verjuice - you, Captain, took a very natural part in the last war - fighting against you king, and against your country. - This was the shot of an invenomed arrow, but integrity, which sat upon the Captain's heart, repelled it - he saw the malignity of the intention, and warmed with an honest ardour, not to resent the injury, but to defend his honour - </p> <p>I fought for bread and for reputation, Madam, answered the Captain - the laws of my country deprived me of my inheritance, but they could not humble my spirit - born a gentleman, I scorned to degenerate into any other character. - A passion for fame, said Maria, is the instinct of all great souls - I bowed to Maria, she construed my bow into an approbation of her sentiment, but it was in fact, a bow of gratitude for the compliment she paid my countryman - </p> <p>The Captain went on - I fought for bread, I fought for reputation, and the instant I</p>

            <p>could acquire bread and reputation under the government of my own country, I returned to her bosom; returned with as ardent affection, heaven knows! as ever lover returned with to the bosom of his mistress! - Miss Verjuice for an instant relaxed her muscles - But while government precluded me from going to heaven by the road which the souls of my ancestors had travelled, I could not fight for that government with zeal, even if she had accepted my service. - Miss Verjuice again braced up her muscles - and you thought purgatory, said Miss Verjuice, the high road to heaven, and gave up your estate in this world, sooner than you would subscribe to the geography of the other world, as laid down by the law. - Do you not think it strange, Sir, continued this amiable virgin, turning her eye upon me, that a man bred to the sword, and who has been spreading desolation over the face of the earth, should have so tender a conscience? - </p> <p>I would have answered the lady - but there was no stopping the tide of the Captain's</p>

Those who invade private property, may be compelled to restitution at the bar of justice. But if independant states have injured us, to what bar shall we cite them? who shall constrain them to appear at our summons? or if they should appear, who shall oblige them to abide by our sentence - open force then must be the dernier resort; and who will be</p>

It is true, said Lucetta, for your Majesty may remember most of the brigade officers who are returned to Ireland, had great O' before their names (1).</p> <p>I remember it well, answered the Queen, blushing. - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) Since the laws against papists have been relaxed in Ireland, several gentlemen who were in foreign services, have returned to their native country.</p>

The stature of the antideluvian giants was calculated from their hip-bones found in Sicily, and the size of the deer, formerly in Ireland, has been calculated from the dimensions of their horns found in the bogs - The French ladies had better materials for calculating, than a thumb, a hip-bone, or a deer's antler - They calculated from the rump - </p> <p>An English ox, said Lucetta, has, I suppose, a rump as large again as an Englishman - and so by a simple rule of division, she measured the limbs of the English prisoners expected at Paris - Lucetta first measured their rumps in her imagination, and thereby hangs a tail - Lucetta whispered in the Queen's ear when she had formed her calulation - you are right, said the Queen to Lucetta, that must be the length, for that is just half the length of an English oxe's horn - we have no such horns in</p>

The hen had escaped, and joined the mate - the boys carried off their prey, the old birds calling in notes of distress - the boys disappeared, hope disappeared with them - the unhappy parents sat silent close to each other for a few minutes, when, as if urged by a mutual despair, they took wing together, and flew from the scene of their wretchedness - </p> <p>There is something, said the Captain, truly distressing, in the exhibition of domestic woe, just presented to us - and should I detect a son of mine in the commission of such a robbery, as the two little rascals have committed, I would punish them as severely as for robbing the church - </p> <p>Why, in truth, said Maria, it is a species of sacrilege - children should be taught to abhor it, to impress the precepts of humanity</p>

            <p>while others possess properties, which make us the most beneficial returns - we owe justice to men, but grace and goodness to brutes - </p> <p>But, said I, adverting to the plunder of the poor thrush, there is a happiness peculiar to subordinate animals of every species, their parental tenderness is but temporary, and their grief on losing their offspring, though it may be severe while it lasts, lasts but a short time; whereas with the human species, such misfortunes produce permanent grief - often terminate in death - </p>

            <p>SLAVE TRADE.</p> <p>MERCIFUL heaven! exclaimed the Captain - when we reflect upon the plunder of the human species, carried on by nations calling themselves christian, professing the divine maxim "do as you would be done by," boasting the benign principles of humanity, and enlightened by the sublime rays of holy revelation, it sinks us, in my opinion, infinitely below the most ferocious beasts of prey, for none of these live by the slaughter and calamities of their own kind. - </p> <p>I perceive, said I, you are execrating the conduct of Europeans to the unhappy children of Africa. - I have often reflected upon our cruelty to those people; first, in carrying them from their native country, and then exercising upon them every cruelty that can</p>
            <pb n="220" xml:id="pb-220" facs="#i228"/>
            <p>debase human nature, or render life miserable. - </p> <p>There is but one way of accounting for this cruelty, said Maria, and Sterne has hit upon it, "the poor Negroes have no one to stand up for them." - </p> <p>They are sacrifices to COMMERCE, said I - </p> <p>You mean to AVARICE, said the Captain - COMMERCE is a mild deity, and never requires human victims to bleed upon her altar. - The fruits of industry and the fruits of the earth are her offerings. Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices; where we find agreeable manners, there commerce flourishes; and wherever there is commerce, there we meet agreeable manners. - So says Montesquieu. - </p> <p>Commercical laws, said I, arguing from the same author, improve manners, but they improve manners from the season reason they destroy them - they corrupt the purest morals, polish and refine the most barbarous. The spirit of trade produces in the mind of man a certain sense of exact justice, but does it</p>

            <p>not produce sanguinary laws and rage of avarice, that overleaps all bound of justice, and tramples upon humanity. The total deprivation of trade produces robbery - but is not hospitality most rare in trading countries, and is it not found in perfection among nations of vagabonds? Among the ancient Germans, to shut a door against a stranger, would be considered as sacrilege. - </p> <p>I shall not take upon me, said Maria, to determine how far such nations may merit the opprobrious term you have given them, but I should rather live and die among such a people, than among the most refined; and I think this hospitality, which must necessarily include in it an assiduity to please, is a convincing proof of the excellency of the human heart in a simple state. - What have we got by our boasted improvements and frivilous politeness, but the loss of manly firmness and independence (1). - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) I could write a very long note upon this. - </p> <p>ED.

            <p>The Captain looked at Maria with astonishment, and seizing her hand with a degree of rapture, exclaimed, you are right - you are right, my girl! Avarice, sensuality, and every species of meanness, have succeeded to generosity and honour; and faction and servitude, with bellowing on one side, and adulation on the other, are storming and undermining the asylum of liberty - almost every man wears the mask of hypocrisy - the noble frankness which marked the character of Englishmen, has dwindled into an affection of sentiment; and in assuming susceptibility of too refined feelings, from feeling like men, we have adopted the manners of women. - Even philosophy participates the refinement of modern manners; she forgets her chaste and simple character - she forgets that she once inhabited the lonely cot of Socrates, and shared the frugal fare of Epaminondas. - Then your legislators and generals - Shew me a modern senator or commander, who will descend from the seat of magistracy or</p>

            <p>regions of servitude, men born free as himself (1).</p> <p>I have served in South America, continued the Captain - I have conversed with the slaves, and have found among them men as capable of generous sentiment, and of as noble soul, as ever distinguished the character of a white - Good heavens! my heart sinks, when recollection presents to my imagination, the misery of these unfortunate fellow-creatures, to whom death alone can give enfranchisement! - </p> <p>Here the Captain stopped - he was too full to proceed - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) It is really astonishing, that in the dependencies of Great-Britain, slavery should be permitted. The court of King's-Bench, in the celebrated negro cause, laid it down, as a principle of the English constitution, that slavery could not exist in this country, and that the instant a negro set his foot on shore, he was free. Surely the principles of the constitution are immutable, and rule in all the dependencies of Great-Britain, though the local laws do not, and therefore slavery cannot constitutionally exist in the dependencies. - F- H-R-VE.</p>

            <p>As we are convinced, said Maria, from our own feelings, that our hearts naturally incline us to relieve misery, and our reason approves it as right - when we consider that providence has infused humanity into our breasts, and has taught us to look to him as an example of mercy; it is astonishing, that pity, and the divine pleasure which results from doing good, should be so far exterminated from mankind.</p> <p>Cruelties, said the Captain, which no tongue can describe, which no heart can conceive, but from the evidence of the eyes, are inflicted upon negroes. The American and West-Indian news-papers, may give a slight idea of the deplorable situation of these unhappy creatures. In these papers, they are advertised as negro fellows, or negro wenches - often described as bearing their tyrannic master's brand upon their cheek - having a padlocked yoke about their neck, or carrying the marks of merciless stripes upon their skin - I have seen them roused by the lash to their labour - drove into stalls in herds like brutes, and fed worse than those</p>

            <pb n="232" xml:id="pb-232" facs="#i240"/>
            <p>of B- was actually smitten with him on account of his forefinger - </p> <p>As the Count had crossed one of the private court-yards, unfortunate for the old Dutchess of B- he had occasion to draw - off his glove - the old Dutchess of B- was at that instant peeping at the Count through a lattice with her magnifying glass, and the forefinger of the Count hit exactly upon her grace's focus.</p> <p>Her grace could not avoid gazing on the Count's forefinger - </p> <p>The Count wore two brilliants on his forefinger - they were family jewels, the Count's father had given them to his mother, his mother had given them to him - they rivetted the eyes of the old Dutchess of B- with as fascinating a power, as if she had gazed upon a rattle-snake - </p> <p>The old Dutchess was experienced in the value of brilliants, and the instant she perceived those on the Count's forefinger, her grace exclaimed, never did I see such a finger!</p>
            <pb n="233" xml:id="pb-233" facs="#i241"/>
            <p>never did I see such brilliants! - they are only fit for a Queen! - </p> <p>The Dutchess of B- was avaricious, therefore the instant the idea of the Queen came across her grace, she concluded, that if these brilliants, which garnished Count O'Dunn's forefinger, could be procured for her Majesty of Portugal - her own fortune was made - </p> <p>Little did the Dutchess of B- think, that by this determination she would serve not only the Queen of Portugal, but the armed neutrality of Europe.</p> <p>Some say that the Count having perceived the old Dutchess of B- speculating through the lattice, and knowing her to be in the Queen's confidence, he drew off his glove on purpose; but whether he did or did not, whether the action was accidental or manoeuvre, it is certain, that the Count O'Dunn got into the Queen's confidence by it - </p> <p>When the old Dutchess of B- informed the Queen of Portugal of what she had seen, her Portuguese Majesty smiled - you</p>
            <pb n="234" xml:id="pb-234" facs="#i242"/>
            <p>must be mistaken, my dear Dutchess, said the Queen, I never heard of so white, so taper a forefinger, nor of such brilliants as you have described - if they are so large, they must be equal in value to the famous diamond worn by the Great Mogul, and exceed that in the hat of the French King - you have been deceived by a false appearance - consider, my dear, dear Dutchess, you were looking thro' a magnifying glass - </p> <p>The Queen was right, and the Queen was wrong - the Dutchess of B- was right - and the Dutchess of B- was wrong - the old Dutchess was deceived, not in the magnitude, but in the quality of what she supposed to be brilliants - they were nothing better than common Irish diamonds, which are plenty in London and Paris - </p> <p>In Lisbon, they had novelty to recommend them - </p> <p>We must keep up decorum, said the Queen of Portugal to the Dutchess of B- before we admit Count O'Dunn to our presence; you must enquire into the nature of his business.</p>
            <pb n="235" xml:id="pb-235" facs="#i243"/>
            <p> - The old Dutchess flew to the anti-chamber, and put the question to the Count, she found him incircled by the Ladies of the court - My business, said Count O'Dunn, is with the Queen herself - and to the Queen herself alone, will I impart my business - </p> <p>Then you will not trust me? said the old Dutchess - </p> <p>By heaven, I will not trust you, my Lady Dutchess, nor any other Lady in the court - the court Ladies hung down their heads - </p> <p>I am keeper of the Queen's secrets - said the old Dutchess of B-</p> <p>But you are not keeper of my secrets, answered Court O'Dunn.</p> <p>The old Dutchess fixing her eye upon the Count's forefinger, took him by the hand, and led him to the Queen's apartment - </p>
            <pb n="236" xml:id="pb-236" facs="#i244"/>
            <p>THE HEM-SIGNAL.</p> <p>THE Dutchess had much at stake, she had drawn a picture for the Queen, and she knew the consequence, if the original should fall short of the copy. She had some doubts from what the Queen had started, that her magnifying glass might have deceived her (1).</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) I was once very much deceived in a scene of my own writing, which depended upon the doctrine of proportions. The figure of an Hercules cloathed was to have been exhibited in my comedy of the WORLD AS IT GOES, alias, SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST, but the villainous property-man, had the fellow who represented the demi-god, put upon the pedestal as naked. I intended the figure should have been fully proportioned in all its parts; whereas a narrow-shouldered man was chosen - so that when the female-virtuoso, who was to have been rendered ridiculous, by applying disproportions to a proportioned figure, came to give her judgment, the satire was lost, the fellow who played the statue being actually, in appearance, "too narrow in the thorax to hold the vital parts, and horridly disproportioned in the fore-shortening of one of his members." - M. C-W-Y.</p>
            <pb n="237" xml:id="pb-237" facs="#i245"/>
            <p>Her fears, however, subsided, upon her interview with the Count. She viewed him without her glass, and joy flushed her cheeks. She measured him with her eyes, as a female virtuoso measures the beautiful representations of nature in the galleries of Italy - </p> <p>The Dutchess of B- had been a woman of remarkable sensibility. Sympathy was her weakness. In her youth she had found the highest satisfaction in communicating pleasure to others, and her greatest pleasure now was in procuring it. Yet no woman had ever given more pain than the Dutchess of B- but then no woman had ever gone further than the Dutchess of B- to alleviate the pain she had given. Man never kneeled to her grace in vain, nor petitioned her grace without relief (1) - </p> <p>The Dutchess of B- having approached the door of the royal closet, gave a loud hem. - This hem informed the Queen of Portugal that Count O'Dunn was near - </p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) An old lady of my acquaintance is just such another merciful character. - H-RR-N, Dowg.</p>
            <pb n="238" xml:id="pb-238" facs="#i246"/>
            <p>Her majesty of Portugal was at that instant standing before a great glass, wrapped up in admiration of herself. All Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal, but no subject in Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal more, than the Queen of Portugal admired herself - </p> <p>Yet the Queen was not vain - she knew the power of her charms, from their effects upon mankind, and the subject of her consideration now was, to muster and draw out in amorous array, their full force armed at all points against Count O'Dunn - </p> <p>But the whole system of the Queen of Portugal's intended operations against the Count, was overturned by the hem-signal of the Dutchess of B-. Every glance, every leer, every smile, every giggle, which art had armed for her assistance and long experience had exercised into discipline, fled at the instant the hem-signal was given; nor could the Queen, with all her generalship, rally them into order - nature had taken possession of their post, and defied the powers of art to dislodge her.</p>
            <pb n="239" xml:id="pb-239" facs="#i247"/>
            <p>THE INTERVIEW.</p> <p>THE Queen of Portugal, as many able commanders have done, threw herself upon chance - she sat upon a sopha - the door of the closet opened - the eyes of the Queen shut - </p> <p>The complexion of the Queen of Portugal was a bright olive - Count O'Dunn never considered colours - he admired the whole sex - every colour had its attraction for him - he loved woman, because she was woman; and to this generous affection he bore to woman kind, may be imputed a passion, the most generous and disinterested, which from his youth he had entertained for an individual.</p> <p>The Count made his obeisance - the Queen opened her eyes - the Count dropped the curtains of his eyes - a dead silence ensued - </p>
            <pb n="240" xml:id="pb-240" facs="#i248"/>
            <p>The Dutchess of B- broke silence - she introduced the Count in form, as plenipotentiary from the court of France, and recollecting his declaration, in refusing to communicate his business to any person but the Queen in private, she retired, as a woman of discretion should - shut the door - fell upon her knees - and applied her eye, close to the key-hole - </p> <p>Had Count O'Dunn been before all the male crowned heads in Europe, he would not have evinced diffidence - had Count O'Dunn been marching up against a battery, he would not have betrayed fear - yet the Count was silent, and trembled before the Queen of Portugal.</p> <p>Pray, Captain, said Maria, perceiving I rested at the conclusion of the last sentence, what made Count O'Dunn tremble?</p> <p>If you do not know, Madam, you must ask the naturalists - answered the Captain.</p> <p>Maria had a quick conception - she found it dangerous to require a more minute explanation - so requested I would proceed - </p>
            <pb n="241" xml:id="pb-241" facs="#i249"/>
            <p>O'DUNN'S NEGOTIATION.</p> <p>HER majesty of Portugal began the negotiation, whereas it was the duty of the Count to have began - but in truth he had forgot the interest of the neutral powers - there was nothing neutral about him -</p> <p>Your prudence, Sir, said the Queen, in not communicating your business to any of my ministers, proves you worthy of your employment - the business of politicks should never be carried on through a medium -</p> <p>It is quite contrary in affairs of love, please your Majesty, answered the Count - </p> <p>You are certainly right, replied the Queen, giving up all thoughts of politicks, a medium in love is to be preferred - and the man who would reach a woman's heart, must first discover the proper medium. - The cool lover is despicable - an over-warm passion is seldom</p>
            <pb n="242" xml:id="pb-242" facs="#i250"/>
            <p>lasting - but I should wish to hear your opinion upon the subject - </p> <p>It is too difficult a subject for me, said the Count, I have attempted to discuss it a thousand and a thousand times, but could never reach the end - love is a subject which defies the power of logick, of philosophy, of mathematicks. - I have tried love every way, said Count O'Dunn, and I have been told, that those who have tried it scientifically and systematically, have found themselves little better than fools upon the subject - </p> <p>I knew a fool, said the old Dutchess of B- taking her eye from the key-hole - who could handle the subject better than the wisest of them all - </p> <p>Bless me, exclaimed the Queen, throwing her eye upon the Count's forefinger, how remiss have I been in keeping you standing so long -</p> <p>It is my duty, answered the Count, to stand in your Majesty's presence - </p> <p>But as you are the representative of a King, replied the Queen, I insist upon your sitting -</p>
            <pb n="243" xml:id="pb-243" facs="#i251"/>
            <p>The Count being seated upon a sopha with the Queen, proceeded upon the business of the neutral powers - he presented his credentials - the Queen of Portugal examined them - she spoke of her obligations to England - the Count withdrew his credentials from her hand - the Queen drew them back - examined them again - the Count pushed the point closer - still the Queen objected, but faintly. The Count maintained his point - </p> <p>Your Majesty may perceive, said the Count, turning up his credentials towards the Queen, so as to shew the two brilliants the Dutchess of B- had mentioned, your Majesty may perceive, said he, it is a plain proposition - </p> <p>The Queen of Portugal answered - </p> <p>The Count O'Dunn replied - </p> <p>The Queen of Portugal rebutted -</p> <p>The Count O'Dunn surrebutted.</p> <p>I submit, said the Queen - you have prevailed - I give England - I give up every thing - I give up the world to your argument, Count O! - </p>
            <pb n="244" xml:id="pb-244" facs="#i252"/>
            <p>Before the Queen could fully pronounce the Count's name, O'Dunn had put the pen in her hand, and her Majesty subscribed to the neutral confederacy - </p> <p>Oh! ejaculated the Queen of Portugal - </p> <p>Ah! ejaculated the old Dutchess of B- and she fell upon the floor - such is the power of sympathy, it flew through the key-hole, and hit the old Dutchess full on the brain - </p> <p>France has carried the day, said the old Dutchess of B- opening the door, and entering the room - </p> <p>Upon the soul, but you are out now, answered Count O'Dunn, as he put up his credentials - it was Ireland that carried the day - so making a bow, he retired, to dispatch a courier to Paris - </p> <p>Now the Dutchess of B- having written an account of O'Dunn's negotiation with the Queen of Portugal, to Madam D'C - Lady of the French Queen's Bed-chamber, the French Queen's insisted, that the French King should recall Count O'Dunn, from an apprehension, that he might be assassinated - </p>
            <pb n="245" xml:id="pb-245" facs="#i253"/>
            <p>UN PETIT SOUPER.</p> <p>THE evening-dew beginning to fall heavy, Maria proposed returning home. When we arrived at the town the Captain took his leave, having previously insisted, that I should accompany him the next morning at six, to see a royal chace.</p> <p>Maria, as we walked towards her lodgings, corroborated my suspicion, that the Captain was dying swain to virgin Verjuice; and assured me of much entertainment from the history of his amours, the Captain having, for a series of years, been a constant dangler after rich old maids, and endowed widows of various descriptions - </p> <p>We found the cloth laid, and supper was served in, almost immediately after we entered the parlour - two plates upon the table informed me, that my company was expected,</p>
            <pb n="246" xml:id="pb-246" facs="#i254"/>
            <p>and having no inclination to retreat suddenly, I saw down to table with as easy familiarity, as if I had been one of the family - I saw Maria was pleased at the frankness of my conduct - and what can be more pleasing than an unceremonious chearful acquiescence in partaking of the hospitable preparations of a friend. - The supper would have lost half its relish by a formal invitation - </p> <p>You must help yourself, said Maria, laying the wing of a duck upon her plate, I followed her example - </p> <p>Here is wine, said Maria - </p> <p>A dumb-waiter, which stood at my right-hand, answered all the purposes of ostentatious attendance - we sat in the full enjoyment of liberty and social festivity - eat, talked, and laughed, without restraint - </p> <p>I must fill to the brim, said I, taking up a decanter of Madeira - Maria smiled consent - it is to the continuance of our love, my dear Maria - Maria blushed - she hung her head, but as she hung her head, she turned up her eye - </p>
            <pb n="247" xml:id="pb-247" facs="#i255"/>
            <p>Let it overflow, said Maria, and she sighed - let it overflow - I will pledge you with all my soul - </p> <p>And I am all impatience, added I - my heart is thirsty for the toast - </p> <p>We sipped from our brimmers - touched glasses, and changed glasses - I tasted the nectar of Maria's lip upon her glass - the touch had raised the sparkle of the wine, and the wine had given her eyes additional lustre - their power was irresistible - I must quench this flame, thought I, as I swallowed my wine - but wine is oil to the lamp of love - the flame from my heart increased - </p> <p>I got close to Maria's side, and pressed her hand - we drank again, touched glasses, and touched cheeks - I had thrown my arm negligently across the back of her chair - my head reclined upon her bosom - Maria rung a bell that lay upon the table, the servant appeared, she ordered him to remove the supper-table - </p>
            <pb n="248" xml:id="pb-248" facs="#i256"/>
            <p>AN ILLUSTRATION,</p> <p>OR THE EXTINGUISHER.</p> <p>DO you know, said Maria, sighing, as the servant left the room, that I have been thinking continually upon the cruelties, which the Captain told us were inflicted upon the poor negroes, by their merciless task-masters - he says there are noble souls among these people - </p> <p>Shakespeare was of the same opinion, said I, when he drew the character of Othello -</p> <p>Your speaking to Othello, said Maria, reminds me of a passage in the play, which I could never understand - I mean that line where Othello says - "Put out the light, and then put out the light." - I could never receive any satisfaction from the commentators. </p> <p>There lay upon a couch, close to Maria, a silver chamber-candlestick and extinguisher - </p> <p>I will give you an illustration of the passage, said I, taking up the extinguisher - </p>
            <pb n="249" xml:id="pb-249" facs="#i257"/>
            <p>"PUT OUT THE LIGHT" - I pressed the extinguisher upon the candles - AND THEN! ! ! - </p> <p>What say the criticks (1) to this illustration (2)? What say their wives (3)?</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>(1) As critic is an animal, not well understood, permit me to give a description of it - </p> <p>But soft, a critic's portrait I espy,</p> <p>Lord! what a jaundiced colour stains the eye;</p> <p>How hard th' expression, without ease or grace,</p> <p>Like Janus too, he wears a double face. - </p> <p>F. PILLION - </p> <p>This description is well, it describes your hermaphrodite, or double-sexed, double-headed critic, with one face brass, the other human. - C-W-Y AND WIFE. - </p> <p>(2) We say, that in our opinion, this is a palpable Irish bull, which we cannot translate the Irish debates of the last sessions of the Irish parliament, for we cannot conceive an illustration in the dark. - WILLIAM W-DF-L.</p> <p>We are all of the same opinion. - The DIURNAL CRITICS of the DAILY PAPERS - </p> <p>(3) We say we can conceive an illustration in the dark, and though our husbands cannot see such an illustration, it is to us clear as the sun. - Cats eyes are not necessary, it is an illustration to the mind's eye; and therefore, if the thing to be illustrated be felt and understood, it is sufficient. - The wives of CRITICS - </p> <p>FINIS.</p> <note>stamp reads 'BIBLCANTACAD'</note>
