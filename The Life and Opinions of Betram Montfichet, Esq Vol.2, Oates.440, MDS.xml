             <note>image - decorative chapter break, historiated initial</note> <p>THE</p> <p>LIFE and OPINIONS</p> <p>OF</p> <p>Bertram Montfichet, Esq;</p> <p>CHAP. I.</p> <p>IT is said of the Philosopher Diogenes, when once upon a time he was discoursing very seriously upon virtues and vices, and did not perceive the least motion towards attention in the eyes or ears of any of his Auditory, that he immediately reclaimed them, some from fiddling, some</p>
            <pb n="2" xml:id="pb-2" facs="#i8"/>
             <p>from telling news, some from napping, some from examining their nails, some from coughing, and the greater part from yawning, by singing for them a pretty song. It is also currently reported of the same Philosopher, that, when the Orator Anaximenes was haranguing the people with exquisite gravity, he held out to them a well pickled neat's tongue, whereby he drew the whole assembly about himself.</p> <p>I have often considered what an elaborate serio-dogmatic Dissertation upon Virtues and Vices would produce. Nothing; - for tho' we all may be induced to gaze upon beautiful and deformed objects, in order to hate the one, and love the other; yet we are unwilling to persist in taking a close view of the beauty of virtue, or deformity of vice. The reason of this reluctance is, because the beauties of virtue are generally painted with too serious an air: She is made to look tart and sullen, scornful and austere; and those who might have been her votaries, if used with lenity, finding so coy a mistress, and almost</p>
            <pb n="3" xml:id="pb-3" facs="#i9"/>
             <p>continually debarred access to her person, fly off with discontent, and at a distance behold here with the same horror they should vice, of whose deformity they are not sensible, by the pleasing alternative of easy condescension to gratify their desires.</p> <p>Let us sing then and play the wag, and let every innocent artifice of the sort help to strew the way to virtue with the flowers of wit an humour. If vice in the shape of an overgrown monster, or diminutive hero, should form a blockade against us; let us sally out upon the miscreant, with a repeated discharge of jests and laughter. Do what he can, you shall find he will never be able to stand the shock with a good countenance. He retreats confounded with shame, his forces are dispersed; he knows not where to rally them; how can he make head again? Had you expostulated with him in the terms of earnest gravity, he would immediately bid defiance, and calling you fool! have the laugh on his side.</p> <p>There's a flavour in a pickled tongue,</p>
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i10"/>
             <p>if pickled by the hand of a Connoisseur, which reflects a deliciousness upon the palate, better felt than described. All other tastes may yield to it without murmuring; and had not Diogenes thought so; nay, was he not persuaded that they would behave with that complaisance, he could not so easily have inveigled away Anaximenes's audience to run after him for a relish. - This much I thought proper to make introductory to my second Volume.</p> <p>CHAP. II.</p> <p>MY Grandmother, my Father, my Mother, my Uncle Dick, my Aunt Dinah, Miss Betsey, my father's eldest daughter, the Doctors Blue, Black, and Red-Beard, Parson Yorrick, Doctor Rantum, and S- F-te, Esq; making in all the exact number of the Nine Muses and Three Graces, were now in a collected body in the parlour, very busy</p>
            <pb n="5" xml:id="pb-5" facs="#i11"/>
             <p>at interchanging compliments and salutations, till my father, with a profound reverence, begged the favour they would step in to the dining-room. A trivial contest here arose about precedency, which my father indeed gave occasion to: for being exceeding tender of the honour of his physicians, for whom his predilection was already but too visible, he motioned their withdrawing the first in order, himself shewing the way. 'By all means (quoth Doctor Blue-beard, affecting a round tone of voice,) the preference should be given to physick: it was the first science that existed in the world.' Parson Yorrick replied calmly, that he believed the first generations of mankind knew more about saying their prayers than taking physick, and as an argument that prayer, which is the same thing as practical divinity, preceded the use of physick, he alledged the custom subsisting among Roman Catholics to this day, of blessing and crossing themselves first, and afterwards blessing and crossing the draughts, powders, pills,</p>
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>boluses, they were to take. 'A laudable custom! upon my reputation, (cried 'Squire F-te:) I much approve of it, and could wish Doctor Rantum would introduce it at mother Cole's, where loads of physick are swallowed down with prayers said backwards, according to the cross purposes of witches and wizards.' - Doctor Rantum, whose complexion it is a hard matter to raise a blush in, appeared unscandalized at this insinuation of the 'Squire: 'Aye, (says he,) what passes in the family of that good and virtuous woman, Madam Cole, is entre nous; I have made her and her whole house, vessels of election, not by large doses of physick for the earthly part, but for the heavenly. Their evacuations in specie have copiously flowed in upon me, as sweetness from the honeycomb: why should I then introduce Popish superstition into so pure a sanctuary? I might as well introduce the unseasonable visits of a Justice, as you, Sir, (clapping the 'Squire on the shoulder) threatned the poor creatures with some time</p>
            <pb n="7" xml:id="pb-7" facs="#i13"/>
             <p>ago, when Mrs. Cole required a pot-companion of yours, to make restitution for leaving Polly Rogers in pawn at her house. I preached a thanksgiving sermon on their deliverance, and had a new hymn sung on the Justice's integrity for taking hush-money.'</p> <p>Doctor Rantum afterwards proved, that he himself, being a divine, and having a far greater number of patients, afflicted with the terrors of guilty consciences, under the cure of the all-healing balsam of his word, than all the physicians in the kingdom could pretend to have in their way; it ought of consequence to be allowed, that physick should yield to divinity, and that therefore he would take the lead himself. He was going to do so, bespeaking my sister Betsey for his guide, when Doctor Red-beard catching him by the sleeve, swore lustily by Galen's method, he would not let him stir an inch, whilst the preference demanded a better regulation than his authority could give it. Words of jealousy and discontent now</p>
            <pb n="8" xml:id="pb-8" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>began to sound pretty loud, and all the fruits of my father's cares and preparations were likely to be blighted in the blossom, had not my Uncle Dick, ever vigilant to compose dissentions on reasonable terms, proposed the blind-folding of every one in the company, as the only expedient to make void all rank and distinction of persons; that he would tie a string about the knob of the dinning-room door and extend it into the parlour, which every one at random was to take hold of when blind-folded, and so grope along as the string should lead; that if they did not do so, he would advise them to walk all promiscuously into the dining-room: for it did not signify who passed first or last, and if the punctilios of state were to be observed, he thought bringing up the rear was much more honourable than patrolling in the front, which indeed is the case in all solemn shews and processions.</p> <p>To contend in civility by an unaffectedly humble and willing disposition, being not so much as thought of, all at last</p>
            <pb n="9" xml:id="pb-9" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>consented to be blind-folded, pursuant to my Uncle Dick's scheme, as the most indiscriminate method of terminating the dispute in a social manner. The Squire held out against it for a few minutes with a damn him, that they might be led into a horse pond; but my father having seasonably remonstrated that this was striking too boldly at his honour, by suspecting a violation of the laws of hospitality, the Squire, as well as the rest, suffered a bandage to be fastened on his eyes by my Uncle Dick, who had taken care to provide a sufficient number of clean handkerchiefs for the six strangers, my father and his family being contented with those they kept in their pockets.</p> <p>Nothing further seemed wanting then to rendezvous them in a cluster about the leading - string, which my Uncle Dick having also done, he made himself as blind a buzzard as the rest, and then gave the word of command to march. 'Pox take the hindmost,' said Doctor Rantum, bustling away up stairs to have the honour</p>
            <pb n="10" xml:id="pb-10" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>of being first in the dinning-room. -  But he was not first - Doctor Black-beard and my Grandmother made better haste than he. It happened the door was not close shut, and by making no resistance against the forward pushes of Doctor Black-beard, down drops my Grandmother, who was before him, on her back, and he a top of her. This stumbling block in Doctor Rantum's way, forced him also into a sprawling situation; but chance made it a delectable one to him. He had got himself twining like ivy round the waist and about the neck of my Aunt Dinah: he could not see, but he could feel, (his hands not being slack in that ministry,) that she was in buxom plight: even her arms seemed to allow him a yielding reception. The spirit moved him to soft dalliance. 'Love!' (he argued thus with himself in an instant of time; for in his strongest perturbations he had the gift of possessing a perfect liberty of spontaneity,) almighty love! is blind, and so am I now: if I sin, it will be a sin of ignorance; nay, no sin:</p>
            <pb n="11" xml:id="pb-11" facs="#i17"/>
             <p>for it is only taking a leap in the dark, for the consequence of which I cannot be accountable.' - I know not what the spirit of darkness, (for I am sure the spirit of light was not then in him) would have prompted him to do, had not in the critical minute, my Grandmother groaned forth 'many a Lord have mercy upon me!' with 'I shall be stifled by this great bear in a moment,' which set my Aunt Dinah a squeaking like a stuck pig. - My Father in great consternation, as well he might, tears the handkerchief from his own eyes, and runs in to relieve his mother and sister. His readiest way was to restore the Doctors to their sight; seeing their error, they would correct it, and he had charity enough for them to believe, it was not an error of their judgment, tho' my Aunt Dinah said she could not tell what to judge of Doctor Rantum's sly tricks in fumbling her as he did.</p> <p>By this time my uncle Dick with my sister Betsey, came in. As to my mother, she had stuck close to my father's skirts,</p>
            <pb n="12" xml:id="pb-12" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>and unmasked in a fright when he did. 'Four of our good company are wanting, (said my father:) what's become of them? I hear nothing of them on the stairs. - Go, brother Dick, and see what they are a doing.' - My uncle Dick went, and returned with the doctors Blue-beard and Red-beard, who had fretted, and were fretting over again their guts to fiddle-strings. The parson and squire soon followed, and entered with a horse-laugh. This disparity of sour faces in the former, and merry ones in the latter, was owing, it seems, to an arch trick the parson and squire had by agreement played upon these two medical personages. - They whispered each other, when going blind-folded to the dinning-room was concluded upon, to take off their garters and tie them together, and when the word of command should be given, to pull away the handkerchiefs from their eyes, and lead effectually the two hoodwinkt doctors into the horse-pond at the side of the house. - The squire promised to be the manager.</p>
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>He turned the doctors from the left to the right, laying their hands upon his own leading-string, which he had lengthened with some small cord the parson gave him out of his pocket. Then mimicking my uncle Dick's voice, with the words, 'This was gentlemen, this way,' he brought them fairly out of the house. But doctor Red-beard smelling, he said, the fresh air, and treading on paved stones, which could not be the way to a dining-room, the parson burst out a laughing, and the doctors thereupon unloosing their eye-bands, the execution failed when there were not above six yards farther to the pond.</p> <p>this silly affair promised three dismal consequences, whilst resentment was still hot, and the smart of the affront still felt. The doctors first threatened to give themselves satisfaction by sword or by pistol; but it being argued by my Grandmother, that it was contrary to the nature of their profession to kill in that manner; they swore secondly, they would do themselves justice by the law. Here they were disuaded</p>
            <pb n="14" xml:id="pb-14" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>by my Mother from holding to what they had sworn, who in a minute's reckoning up on her fingers laid before them a sum total of their expences in carrying on the suit, and one penny damages a compassionate jury might perhaps grant them. "If that be the case, away with law, said Doctor Blue-beard; but I see no reason why the business of importance we have been here cited upon, should be ludicrously traduced in the persons of those who are to transact it: rather let us be gone, and wipe off the disgrace by declining an association with some licentious humours, that refuse in spite of art to be brought under any just regimen." - This was the third consequence, and a very alarming one to my father. What should he do if his Physicians broke loose? He might go whistle for advice, as my Uncle Dick told him. - "Nay, he need not, as Doctor Rantum assured him with his Doctrine and face of Assurance, for if he should but confide in him, he would most assuredly lead him through thick and thin</p>

             <p>to the new birth he so much desired, and then advise with him better than any man living, about things above, and things below; and things in the middle; and things to the right, and things to the left; and things before, and things behind; and things in the clouds, and things out of the clouds: all manner of things, in short, being within his grasp, which he had in his power to dispense in handfuls; and if any one was of so little faith as to question this his power, he would produce certificates of it, signed by the Dutch Governor of New Holland; as how, St. Paul had transmigrated into hi, the said Doctor Rantum, and that he, the said Doctor Rantum, was now become all to all men."</p> <p>Doctor Rantum had taken the wrong sow by the ear. My Father was neither so credulous nor so ignorant as to pin an inch of faith to his sleeve, and therefore none were surprized at his whispering immediately Parson Yorrick, so as to be heard all over the dining-room, that he believed Doctor Rantum's certificate of being St.</p>

             <p>Paul, was an arrant piece of forgery of his own, and that in his opinion he was merely Doctor Rantum and nothing else with his whole bundle of things. Doctor Rantum, either put out of his routine, or artfully dissembling the check he had received, made no reply. However, as it was my Father's interest, that all his guests should be quite complaisant to the Physicians; - to dispose them to it, to suppress all past and future animosities, and make harmony and a good understanding reign at his table, (warning being now given that the dinner would be ready to be laid upon it in less than half an hour,) he found it necessary to make the speech, which begins the next chapter.</p> <p>CHAP. III.</p> <p>"GENTLEMEN, I do not know that I ever saw the fact recorded in any of our histories, but tradition has</p>
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i23"/>
             <p>informed us, how a person's posteriors had been once so retentive of modesty in the royal presence, that the expulsive muscles of a flatus, were counter and retro-acted by the compressive valves of the sphincter ani, and to such a degree of repulsion, that the flatus being obliged to recoil, and yet finding no vent by eructation, (modesty and decency abhorring the one as much as the other) raised a furious hurricane of intestine commotions, which blowing at first with blustring rage in all manner of directions, at last discharged the ravaging force on the head, and put a period to the inflated patient's life. - - This oratorial period, which, by the bye, I think, I have ciceronianly acquitted myself of, may be reduced, for perspicuity sake, to a simple proposition, viz. "That a man ashamed to let a fart before the king, died by holding it." - Now, as the king, by a due exercise of his royal benevolence, was graciously pleased, to have written over his Audience-Chamber door, 'All F-rts are free here;' in order, no doubt, to obviate</p>
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i24"/>
             <p>the inconveniencies and sometimes grievous disasters, occasioned by the detention of winds in an unlawful captivity; - so I, as king, lord, and master in my own house, do allow, by a similar reason, unto every one here present, a full and intire liberty of speech. Great inconveniencies often a rise from reserved or obscure words. He that wraps them up within folds of obliquity, whilst he gives no hold to his own, is generally striving to catch at the words of others. I would not, however, have words fly out into strains of licentiousness. Tho' the king was deeply concerned for the loss of a well behaved subject, who did not dare to break wind before him, and was withal good-natured enough to prevent such accidents for the future; yet it could not be presumed that his royal grant was a charter for impudent f-rt-ng, or that it authorized every on to come f-rt-ng into his presence. He must repute it a high crime and misdemeanour in any of his courtiers, especially in the ladies of honour, if they</p>
            <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>put upon it an interpretation of such latitude; because, if petulant notions of that sort were once reduced to flagrant practice, there would be either an absolute necessity for a revocation of the licence, or the planting of a ventilator to keep the place sweet and wholesome. Hence may be seen the imprudence of universal concessions; tho' if we consider the proposition, "All F-rts are free here," by the precision of logic; it will be so far from being an universal affirmative, or importing an unlimited privilege, that with truth, it can be resolved into a particular affirmative, as, "Some f-rts are free here;" that is f-rts of necessity, which it is much better to let than keep.' - With these words my father let a rouzer: 'There, added he, gentlemen, is a specimen of f-rt-ng will not clear up what I had to say, unless I tell you in plain terms, that our banquet must be consecrated to all the essentials</p>
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>of mirth, good humour, and good countenances to one another. When I say this, I say all; and therefore it must be concluded, that I forbid and banish all indecent wrangling; all pretensions to superior merit; all reflections tending to depreciate another's character or profession; all political toasts and healths, which the throat may swallow down, but the heart cannot digest; all descanting upon favourite maxims, which, when not generally allowed of, may be destructive of the laws of society: and here I give fair warning to Doctor Rantum, requesting it also as a particular favour, that he will not by his usual methods strive to methodize into his principles of Antinomianism, any one of the company, more especially my wife; for I would not have her upon any account refractory, much less wear the breeches, through a spiritual persuasion of a right to govern me, when she has spent my money by pretended free gifts on the Doctor, to be distributed by him for adding to the number of the elect in his spiritual kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i27"/>
             <p> - Rather let Doctor Rantum shew himself here with an unclouded brow, the self-same unhypocritical, unmasqueraded, unsophisticated arch wag, he exhibits himself in some scenes of private devotions amidst his boon companions, when with sparkling wine, and tobacco to whet the relish, his face shines in smiles on the unspeakable success of the pious frauds, he perseveringly perpetrates in virtue of his own extraordinary mission. - I have only a few words more to subjoin, and these are in favour of my good friends the doctors of physick. Let my reasons be thought substantial for considering them as my principal guests; yet let no therefore the other gentlemen presume they are under the denomination of incidental guests. Every one in his way is to be a necessary constituent, equally with what we are to eat and drink, of the component parts of our symposion; I mean, by furnishing a dish of discourse: for a Mr. Humdrum, who eats and drinks, and says nothing, has no business among us. Come then,</p>
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i28"/>
             <p>let all hands meet in a shake of amity, and when the shaking is over, it will not be amiss if we agree, by a majority of votes or otherwise, upon some ingenious device, which may occasionally fill up a chasm of conversation. I will have it inscribed over the dining-room door in legible letters, and all may pass what comment on it they please."</p> <p>My father's speeching now over, it was outwardly received with a sort of general applause, like a new king's proclamation; but how it took inwardly, I am not a judge of. Doctor Rantum, against whom a caveat had been lodged in it, was not quite so alert as the rest in his demonstrations of intire satisfaction, nor so hearty in the friendly squeezing of hands. A fit of mystic contemplation might perhaps have seized him that moment, and made him regardless of a ceremonial purely human. However, as his eyes, the index of his mind, did not seem more estranged than they naturally were, no alienation of affections was imputed to him; and he</p>
            <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i29"/>
             <p>readily concurred in writing down his device on a slip of paper, being desirous with the physicians that nothing should keep back dinner: he was hungry, and so were they; the amusement of devices was but a poor stay in empty stomachs.</p> <p>It was my uncle Dick's projection, that each person was to write his or her device, with his or her name and surname to it, on a slip of paper; and when all the slips were put into his cap, to draw them like a lottery; the first and last drawn to be those which should have the honour of appearing, the one over the dining-room door, the other over the fire-place. This was no sooner proposed than done. Parson Yorrick's device was, Ridiculum acri melius ac fortius; <note>Latin</note> that of Doctor Blue-beard, 'Î BÎ¹Î Î²Ï±Î±ÏÏÏ Î®Î´Îµ ÏÎ·ÏÏÎ· Î¼Î±Ï°ÏÎ®; <note>Greek</note> that of Doctor Black-beard, Valetudo potior auro; that of Doctor Red-beard, InvitÃ¢ MinervÃ¢ nihil; that of the Squire, Totus mundus agit histrionem; that of Doctor Rantum, La bontÃ© des femmes; that of my Grandmother, Frugality; that</p>
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i30"/>
             <p>of my Father, Mens sana in corpore sano; <note>Latin</note> that of my Mother, Fidelity and obedience; that of my uncle Dick, Vivitur ingenio; that of my aunt Dinah, A good husband and soon; and that of my sister Betsey, Modesty.</p> <p>My uncle Dick stood blindfolded, shaking the paper-slips in his cap, and my grandmother, who had recommended herself to execute the function of drawer, was also blindfolded. This precaution was judged expedient, that picking and chusing might be prevented. My uncle Dick's device was the first drawn, and Doctor Rantum's the last. nothing, as my uncle Dick said, could happen more apropos: for all the gentlemen my father was pleased to invite to his table, had no other visible means of livelihood but their wits. He spoke in the common way of conceiving things; for wit being wholly intellectual is not a visible means, though thousands and thousands live by it, without leaving so much sensible work behind, as a cobler does in a pair of</p>
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i31"/>
             <p>mended old shoes. - VIVITUR INGENIO <note>Latin</note> was struck over the door in large capitals; and la bontÃ© des femmes was sent in italics, to take an airing over the fire. Without any more ado, the other devices were pocketed by their owners, yet were allowed to have a good deal in them, notwithstanding their fate of coming up blanks.</p> <p>No other impediment now intervened to retard summoning the first dish on the table, than stationing the company in proper order. The table, physically speaking, was a perfect square, so that whoever wanted humility, could not regret being situated at the lower end. The women occupied one side; the Doctors Blue, Black and Red-beard fat facing them; my father and the squire placed themselves in the middle, on another side, between the Parson and Doctor Rantum; the Squire desired to be next the Parson: and my uncle Dick, for elbow-room, had a whole side left to himself, because he was the carver and demonstrator of the feast, or</p>
            <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i32"/>
             <p>in more decent terms, the master of the revels.</p> <p>CHAP. IV.</p> <p>QUOD FELIX, FAUSTUM, FORTUNATUMQUE SIT, <note>Latin</note> was the grace of the ancient Romans, which my uncle Dick pronounced with exquisite gravity, and to which my father as gravely, and the rest of the company after him, answered, PROFICIAT. - "I could wish too, said my uncle Dick, waving his wand about, that we were lolling at our ease, as the ancient Romans were wont, on their beds. What a misfortune it is, that the use of triclinium has ceased? If it was still the fashion, what a goodly figure we should make, our heads appearing magnificently erect, over soft bolsters supporting our elbows, or any other part of the body we might covet to keep at ease. However, though modern, but less convenient customs, have debarred us this pleasure, nothing</p>
            <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i33"/>
             <p>Hinders our eatables from being calculated for, and cooked in the Roman taste. - Come, good folks, we shall now fall to; and as the Romans began with eggs and ended with apples, so shall we."</p> <p>A hand-bell, my Uncle Dick kept by him on the table, was rung, and in comes a servant with a dish of eggs. There was just an egg a-piece. My grandmother warranted them to be all new-laid that morning, having taken them with her own hands out of the hen-roost, where none but the nest-eggs were the night before. - "And I warrant them to be all true game, said my uncle Dick; for we have not a dunghill-fowl about the house.@ - 'It appears too, said the Parson, that they are all cock-eggs: see here, what a fine oblong thing this egg of mine makes!' - It must be luscious nourishing food, said Doctor Rantum: I wish I could come at a couple of such every night to make up my supper: besides clearing my pipe, they would be conducive to another good</p>
            <pb n="28" xml:id="pb-28" facs="#i34"/>
             <p>purpose in a love-feast.' - 'Aye, said the Squire, Doctor R---ks invigorating viper drops, are but a fool to them: take my word for it, Doctor Rantum, that you would become so mercurial by game-cock-egg-eating, that in short every corner of the realm would soon boast of a preacher of the word by your propagation.' - 'I must confess, said Doctor Black-beard, that the Materia Medica <note>Latin</note> stands highly in-debted to new-laid eggs for the propagation of the human species: as to their abilities for propagating preachers of the word, Hippocrates is quite silent in that respect.' - 'Marry, I believe so, said my grandmother; Hippocrates was no Christian: if he was, he must have known that propagation of preachers of the word was to be by sending them; How shall they preach unless they are sent?' - 'Right, mother, said my father, Doctor Rantum can no more propagate preachers of the word by egg eating, than he can by the imposition of hands: he can't by the imposition of hands; for he is no bishop;</p>
            <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i35"/>
             <p>therefore, none of his preachers are sent, and if they are not sent, they have no more right to preach than my black mare has.' - 'They are sent from Heaven, answered Doctor Rantum; their mission is not an ordinary mission from man, but a mission extraordinary from divine authority.' - 'I deny it, replied my father; an extraordinary mission must prove its authenticity by miracles, which no me-st preacher has dared yet to pretend to.' - 'Is it not a miracle, and a great one, which our eyes have seen, answered again Doctor Rantum, that the people called Me-st preachers, have, and do still draw after them such a number of followers' - "Pish! replied again my father, the seduction of followers is no miracle, much less an argument of an extraordinary mission. Hacket, Muggleton, and Nayler had their followers: who will say that they had a divine commission for preaching and teaching? Vulgar minds are prone to gape after novelties, howsoever monstrous and ridiculous. Promise them Heaven by a</p>

             <p>Doctrine of Assurance, the common bait and artifice of all forgers of new sects and new lights, and you will find them ready at the nod of their leaders, to subvert all laws, divine and human. The Saracens ravaged half the globe by the assurance made them of a life of immortality. Are not Christians taught in the most rational manner by the word of God, to work out their salvation by fear and trembling; to hope and not to despair? How then can they be guilty of the damnable sin of presumption? They are in, and of themselves, poor, naked, and miserable. If they are saved, it is in consequence of the justice from obedience, imputed to them by the means of grace laid down in the gospel; it is in consequence of the mercies of God. If they forfeit their baptismal innocence by actual sin, a sincere repentance with firm purposes of amendment, is their new birth unto righteousness and nothing else. Thus the whole system of Methodo-Antinomianism must fall to the ground, and no argument in the opinion of an honest</p>
            <pb n="31" xml:id="pb-31" facs="#i37"/>
             <p>and reasonable man will be able to raise it from its abject and contemptible state." - I beg leave, Mr. Montfichet, said parson Yorrick, directing his discourse to my father, to make a little addition to what has been mentioned concerning the power and right, Me-sts, without a lawful mission, have invested themselves with for preaching and teaching. They slily give out that they find no fault with the established church of England, no error in doctrine, nothing amiss in discipline. Why then have they separated themselves from that church? By becoming thus Separatists, those even among them, who had their orders from the church of England, are suspended ipso facto from the exercise of all ecclesiastical functions; so the Canon Law intimates: those, who are mere laymen, illiterate mechanics, ignorant of any good system of Divinity, yet preach and teach, as if called to the honour of priesthood, like Aaron, are punishable by the Common Law of the land. The Scriptures also expressly prohibit</p>
            <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i38"/>
             <p>such from meddling with the ministry: they are thieves and robbers according to the gospel; and God in the Old Testament has denounced his vengeance against them, in the persons of Saul, Uzziah, Korah with his accomplices; and Hananiah was cut off by the hand of God, from the land of the living, because he pretended to the authority of a divine commission for his own inventions.' - Doctor Rantum here appeared in great confusion, which my uncle Dick perceiving, 'Come, Gentlemen, said he, let an end be put to the dispute: by bandying about so much physick and divinity on a single egg, we shall insensibly lose ourselves in serious reflections, and forget the main point of our dinner. - I am going to call up the next dish.' - 'Stop a moment, said the Squire, I have not got to the bottom of my egg yet. - It is fit the affair of the me-st propagating egg should be cleared up, which I shall do in one or two short sentences. The me-sts by propagating themselves without a mission, become</p>
            <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i39"/>
             <p>like some hens that lay eggs without a communication with cocks. What are the eggs so layed? What are they called without the thread of life in them? addled eggs, wind eggs; so are the brains of all me-st preachers, addled and windy; and so it was a mistake in saying before, that Doctor Rantum could propagate preachers of the word by true game eggs: it is evident he cannot, as not being able to give them a mission.' - Here my uncle Dick asked if any one else had a mind to speak further about the eggs; if not, he would order upon the table something that would furnish more copious topics for discourse. He was answered by Doctor Red-beard, that the school of Salernum advised drinking after eggs, and that if a person was to make an intire dinner of eggs, he ought to take a hearty draught of some good liquor after every egg. Doctor Blue-beard affirmed the truth of the position, and Doctor Black-beard declared the observation to be exceeding just. 'By all means, said my father, there's good ale, beer and</p>
            <pb n="34" xml:id="pb-34" facs="#i40"/>
            <p>cyder in abundance, and you shall have rum-punch after dinner. Nothing is eaten or drank in my house but what may be said to be a home produce, or of our colonies.'</p> <p>CHAP. V.</p> <p>A Capacious family-tankard, filled with humming October, and preferable to any French wine, or other exotic beverage, went round. The physicians smacked their lips, and protested that it was pure stuff. Doctor Rantum, as if he had met with no rebuff, joined them chearfully in opinion. "You will relish the liquor as well as any Free-Mason, said my uncle Dick, ringing his bell a second time, when you once taste of my Porcus Trojanus, <note>Latin</note>which I shall now order out of the oven." Porcus Trojanus! said one; Porcus Trojanus! said another: yes; Porcus Trojanus! you need not be surprized, answered my uncle Dick; in English, a Trojan Hog, the finest and most subtantial</p>

            <p>dish in the world; nay, I may say, of exquisite charms to the palate by the variety it will please with upon trial. - You will find some, and chiefly among the prime of our nobility, extremely fond of French cookery and French dainties, and if you believe them, every where but in France, they have remarked incongruities and barbarisms in the bon goÃ»t. - "Lard! upon my honour, says my Lord Duke, just returned from Paris, there is not a spot in the world that suits high life better, Ah! le beau sejour! There, nothing is served up in the rude dress of nature; every dish shews elegance and erudition. Sweet French! ye are possessed of the greatest capacity of any people in the world in the science of delicious morsels. The smell is as ravishing as the taste, of your soops, ragoÃ»ts and fricassees; your curious pain molÃªt, with a raised crust an inch deep, gently melts in the mouth like a lump of sugar; in short, all your various meats and sauces are so ingeniously disguised, that the gross taste of an English</p>

            <p>beef and pudding mangeur could not discern between flesh and fish, fowl and a lord mayor's custard."</p> <p>'Could any one forbear laughing to hear such Frenchified Jean-potages speak so brilliantly of French eating, especially if they had a sight of, or were invited to any of their regalios in the haut goÃ»t, as I was. - The last time I took a trip to Paris, - I'll make my story as short as possible: - we have still three minntes full to run, - (looking at his watch) - before the Porcus Trojanus <note>Latin</note> can be cleverly extricated out of the oven, and without molestation be laid on a tin-vessel, in the form of a dripping-pan, with four handles, I had on purpose made to contain it and its gravy, without letting a drop out. - Well then, - the last time I took a trip to Paris, I had a message-card from Madam de Pompadour, inviting me to dine with her at a lodge in the Bois de Boulogne. There was also an item in the message that the French king was to be there incog. but that if I reconnoitred his latent majesty, I was</p>
            <pb n="37" xml:id="pb-37" facs="#i43"/>
            <p>to take no notice of it. - Now you shall hear what we had for dinner; and if after eating of my Porcus Trojanus, <note>Latin</note> you can say that Madam Pompadour's fare was better, I will give you leave to crop me.'</p> <p>Being at the place of rendezvous, and seated at table among the beau monde in a magnificent saloon; two soops were first served up: the one, of vipers, accurately seasoned with a clove of garlick, and a dozen cantharides reduced to an impalpable powder: the skins of the vipers being crisped and fried in ambergrise garnished the dish. The other soop resembled in colour the lustre, I may indeed say, of a beautiful pearl: in the midst of the dish stood erect a large peacock; his tail was decorated with his most shining plumage artfully stuck-anew into it; out of his bill hung a dozen ortolans, and his pinions reared up a dozen swallows, six on a side. This our first course being taken away, on the middle of the table was placed a badger's ham and colliflowers, swimming in oil of sweet almonds cold</p>
            <pb n="38" xml:id="pb-38" facs="#i44"/>
            <p>drawn. On one side, was a stew of snails, which were purged in ass's milk, and stewed, as Madam Pompadour averred, in virgin honey, with plenty of the most fragrant spices. On the other side, was a fricasee of frogs; which had been first backed in a paste of conserve of roses, and afterwards let to simmer over a slow fire in pomatum, perfumed with spirits of violets. At the upper end of the table, were three roasted hedge-hogs, with pudding of pistacho-nuts in their bellies, and a luscious sauce made of their brains: and, at the lower end was a plump polecat, nicely larded with bacon, and well basted with civet. These dishes were succeeded by different piles of jellies, conserves, sweet-meats, and the best fruits the season afforded. The sweetmeats, according to the position they were first laid in, upon the table, represented - as the French king himself told me, who sat just at my elbow, and whom I knew by the ogles and smiles exchanged between him and Madam Pompadour; - Monsieur Descartes'</p>

            <p>system of vorticles, and some of the ladies discussed very learnedly every interesting point in his Three Elements, especially subtil matter, and - </p> <p>CHAP. VI.</p> <p> - A GREAT bustle was heard at the dinning-room door. My uncle Dick, who knew the cause of it, put a stop immediately to any other remaining unrelated implement of Madam Pompadour's feast, crying out, "Now for my Porcus Trojanus! <note>Latin</note> here, it comes! it comes! make ready!"</p> <p>Accordingly four stout men, preceded by the cook, entered, bearing up, each by a handle, the huge tin-dish with the hog lying on his back in it. A mat that measured the length and breadth of the dish was laid on the table for its reception, and this mat served the double use of keeping the dish steady, and the cloth clean and unhurt.</p>
            <pb n="40" xml:id="pb-40" facs="#i46"/>
            <p>The spectacle was equally astonishing and new! - "'Tis a noble dish, faith, (said the Squire;) but it may be a question among the Jewish Rabbins, whether we shall be able to eat one morsel of the hog. - Look, pray to the belly. - How, the devil! have the puddings and bowels been extracted? Or, are they not there yet? The belly is plump and full. Where has it been cut open? Where has it been sewed up again? No incision, no future visible! Fine cookery! to dress a hog and leave a bundle of gits in his paunch. Fine eating! transfused with the concocted flavour of the set and chance meals the animal has made these seven days past. We shall have bye and bye such a damnable hogo, that we must wish ourselves forty miles off."</p> <p>The three Physicians and Doctor Rantum looked dismal, on hearing, contrary to custom, such serious and earnest animadversions from the Squire. Their own eyes, and well grounded suspicions could also verify, that there was a monstrous erratum</p>
            <pb n="41" xml:id="pb-41" facs="#i47"/>
            <p>committed in the cooking of an unexenterated hog. Perhaps they thought, among other things, it was a hard case to come from afar in expectation of a good dinner, and have nothing they could eat but an egg. In short, a profound silence in words, and a minute's continuance, ensued after the Squire had spoke. The Doctors Blue and Black-beard hanging down their heads; the Doctors Red-beard and Rantum reading one another's faces; my grandmother grinning at the Squire; my father and mother smiling at the Parson; my aunt Dinah and sister Betsey stuffing their mouths with their handkerchiefs to stifle a tittering laugh; and my uncle Dick driving out laughter by whole cheek-fulls. 'What's this I see? You have sow'red, Squire, some faces here at table;' (said my uncle Dick, breaking this odd silence, and suddenly replacing his countenance with as much gravity, as it had before been queerish with risibility.) 'Yes, and you may have done great mischief to some stomachs. Your heart imagines,</p>
            <pb n="42" xml:id="pb-42" facs="#i48"/>
            <p>and well it may, that my Porcus Trojanus <note>Latin</note> comes full and not empty; perhaps, good Sir, and what then, if the thing be so: but, methinks, such a choice spirit as you, ought not to be ignorant of the joyful catastrophe of the cook and hog in Petronius. Trimalchio there in concert with his cook, played a sort of farce, which I did not intend to bring upon the stage here. His guests expressed their concern that the poor hog had been so ill used, and the pleasing hopes of their palates, worse; and one of them would not even forgive the cook if he forgot to gut a fish. But I will shew you, how agreeably they were undeceived. - Chear up once more, and gaze upon my hog with raptures."</p> <p>My uncle Dick, before he had done speaking the last words of his remonstrance, snatched up the carving knife, and making cautiously two cuts not deeper than the skin, the one longitudinal, from the throat over the breast quite down the belly; the other transversal,</p>

            <p>from the back-bone beneath the short ribs on one side, to the back-bone beneath the same ribs on the other; then inclining the hog with the belly towards the raised rim of the dish, he slashed like lightning thro' the cuts, yet with a steady and even hand: this he did, to keep the gravy from cascading by too scanty a fissure on the table; then again cutting a semicircle clean out of the upper side of the paunch, hog's-liver, and blood puddings, quails, black-birds, thrushes, larks, sparrows and oysters came tumbling out.</p> <p>What a pleasing alternative was this to spirits almost fainting under the chilling fears of a spoled dinner! To spirits, which at first thanked God for sending such excellent meat, but soon after were bent upon cursing the devil for sending such damned cooks! Their tongues ran glib in applauding my uncle Dick's ingenuity. No court sycophant could more beflummery the donor of a place or pension. The Squire, for his part, in terms of the humblest submission, asked pardon for</p>

            <p>his wrong-headed surmize. In fine, every complexion looked uncommonly gay and florid, charming and charmed. The birds were delicious, so was the pork; and it was allowed nem. con. that a bit f the one, and a bit of the other, eaten together, would brighten the ideas of the dullest alderman in Norwegian Lapland.</p> <p>It ought to be a maxim in symposiacs, but whether it has been one, I am not versed enough in history to determine; - that when a man is hungry, his meal to his liking, and himself at perfect liberty to cut and come again, he ought to remain undisturbed without the obtrusion of any impertinent question on his mandibles, and till such time as his latrant craving has almost subsided: then indeed, he may talk and eat, and talk and eat again: neither his body nor mind will grumble at the vicissitude; trituration will be better performed in his mouth, and the action of fermentation in his stomach will more easily maturate the first digestion. - My uncle Dick, wise and prudent</p>

            <p>upon most occasions, had undoubtedly something like this maxim in view. If he spoke a word, it was only a word of encouragement to eat heartily, and cut where every one liked best. My father seemed to aim at making a motion for starting some question; my uncle Dick knit his brows into negative signs; so that nothing properly was asked after but the saltseller, mustard-pot, vinegar-bottle, loaf of bread, and tankard of ale, till one side of the hog was made a skeleton, and very few remnants appeared of the belly-contents.</p> <p>"Come, gentlemen, here is something to amuse yourselves with (said my uncle Dick, turning up the untouched side) 'till we have our next and last Roman dish, which will be but a taste, or small matter; therefore you may think the Porcus Trojanus <note>Latin</note> ought to be chiefly attended to: spare it not; it was designed to be eaten, and as such, none can be more welcome to it, so my brother says, so I say, and so I answer for the rest of the</p>

            <p>good Montfichet family here present. - But, as the proof of the goodness of a thing is in the use of it, and, as you have all proved the goodness of my Porcus Trojanus's, <note>Latin</note> by eating of it with the satisfaction of men of hale constitutions, and not like puny, squeamish, piddling, finical ladies, it is now seasonable to give you the process of preparing and cooking the Porcus Trojanus, and to tell you also why it was so called: for I must believe you are strangers to the existence of such a dish in ancient cookery; I except the parson; he shewed no emotion of regret about the neglect of exenteration; consequently it is probable, he knew how the affair was conducted."</p> <p>"The ancient architects of the gratifications of gulosity, have projected the cooking and serving up at table of a whole ox, camel, and various kinds of animals. Hence the Trojan hog came into request, and it was so called from concealing in its paunch a variety of other dainties, as the Trojan horse formerly concealed a number</p>
            <pb n="47" xml:id="pb-47" facs="#i53"/>
            <p>of armed men. Macribius tells us in the third book of his Saturnalia, that Cincius in the oration, whereby he enforced the observance of the Fannian law for moderating expence, objected to his cotemporaries their luxurious humour of having Trojan hogs at their tables. Brawn and the Trojan hog, were therefore prohibited by the sumptuary laws. - The hog was killed by a wound under the shoulder: afterwards, being let to bleed copiously, all the intestines and inwards were taken out; and when the hog was often and thoroughly washed with wine, and hung up by the feet, and again washed with wine, he was well seasoned with salt and pepper, and put into a large cauldron to parboil. Being taken out, he was crammed full of blackbirds, thrushes, beccaficoes, oysters, cockles, and a sufficient quantity of good gravy, mixed and beaten up with the yolks of eggs, all thrust and poured down the throat into the belly. Thus far prepared, a paste was made of flour, wine and oil, which</p>
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i54"/>
            <p>being wrapped about him, he was carefully laid on a brass table, brightly polished, and so put into a well heated oven to bake. When it was judged he was enough, by the time he lay in the oven, and the parched colour of the paste, he was taken out, and the paste being clean peeled and scraped off, he was carried up to table in triumph, lying upon his back on a silver dish, the inside gilt with gold: the glaring shew of the dish, accompanied with the pomp of players on musical instruments, both they and the servants that carried the hog, being crowned with chaplets of flowers, was calculated, I suppose, to do honour to an animal, which cooked in this manner, afforded such noble food."</p> <p>"If you are willing, gentlemen, continued my uncle Dick, to know more particulars concerning this important matter, I refer you to Athenaeus's ninth book of Diphnosophists, from which my memory has partly suggested to me what I here told you. - I have not scrupulously imitated</p>

            <p>the directions in the dressing of my Porcus Trojanus. <note>Latin</note> Some things I thought better altered. I did not parboil him. I seasoned him with a greater variety of spices. Wine I thought too expensive to wash him with; salt and warm water served the purpose full as well. The gravy was not thickened with yolks of eggs for fear of curdling. No paste was laid over; paper clean and white, well daubed with butter, was a sufficient preservative against scorching. When one side was brown and crisp, the other received the same benefit by turning. The crackle, you know, was very nice. Do; put some of it in your pockets: if you have wives or little children at home, it will please them mightily. And not, as I have made you as wise as myself in the slaying, gutting, washing, seasoning, stuffing, cooking, and eating of the Porcus Trojanus, I have nothing more to say than Plaudite porcelli porcorum pigra propago!"</p>

            <p>CHAP. VII.</p> <p>'IT is a rough compliment you pay us, (said Doctor Black-beard;) however, the purveyor that feeds us in so plentiful and savoury a manner ought to have no reprisals made on him.' - 'I see no roughness in the compliment, (said Doctor Red-beard;) by AEsculapius, I am now as lazy as any fat unwieldy hog, not able to wag; so distended are my abdominal muscles; but my heart is light.' - 'So will your whole corpus, in an hour or two, (said Doctor Blue-beard:) Does not the school of Salernum tell you that pork is of easy digestion? Nay, it is so congenial to our carnose parts, that no other food mingles with them so soon to produce the same configurations.' - 'I always imagined, (said the Squire,) that the alimentary juices and particles of pork were athletic, and therefore prescribed by the ancient regulators of diet to invigorate the constitution. Painful exercises</p>

            <p>required a proportionate manner of living, and pork was found by experience to answer the purpose.' - 'That argues nothing, said Doctor Rantum, against pork being of easy digestion. Gross and heavy meats influence the body with dull phlegmatic humours; consequently, as staying long on the stomach, they must rather be of detriment than service to those, whose joints were to exert a supply play of active force, whose muscles were to be perfectly elastic. - Well! now I know the charms of pork-eating, I believe I shall in earnest bid good bye to preaching and teaching, and entertain no other thought during the rest of my days, than regaling myself with those who bore the heat of the day with me, and some select followers, on the Porcus Trojanus, <note>Latin</note> and the many pretty things, we shall take care to cram his belly with. Some of my t-b-rn-cl s I shall convert into hog-sties, others into ale-houses and taverns. All comers shall eat at free cost; and if so, they will not begrudge to pay</p>

As I was never admitted into the profound mysteries, never fully instructed in the sacred symbols of methodism, I cannot descend to particulars, nor describe things with any certainty. I cannot personally and positively assert the reality of dark rooms, naked figures, rattling chains, and typical fires, with the mystical pangs of the new birth, though my intelligence came from a right trusty centinel, a watchman of the night. But, as a specimen of what may be transacted under the veil of night, amidst these frantick nocturnal revels, your own account [W-] is very descriptive.' - "There was a confused noise, as if a number of men were putting to the sword: you [W-] came down about two in the morning, on a watch-night, and heard a noise which represented the yellings of hell," - Superabundant piety!

His intent was to see if ever a bird had escaped discovery in any unrouted creek of the hog's inside. These were the Greeks, he said he would take pleasure in unkenneling, or ferreting out. My uncle Dick was so complaisant as to lay open for him the hog's throat. Not a Greek was visible. They were all demolished. Doctor Rantum was therefore obliged to take his last relish from the brawny part of the bum. However, the morsel was to his mind; and his exaggerated approbation of it induced Doctor Blue-beard to help himself to a slice in the same place.</p> <p>My father in the mean time was eager to know, why Doctor Rantum designed to change his course of life on account of</p>
            <pb n="57" xml:id="pb-57" facs="#i63"/>
            <p>indulging his appetite with the Porcus Trojanus, <note>Latin</note> and why on that account he was to make so sudden a transition from Christianity to Paganism. He whispered the parson to put the question to him, which he declined, re-whispering him, "that to a man, who made a farce and trade of religion, Atheism, or Paganism, or Judaism, or Mahometanism, was quite indifferent. all might be equally eligible to him as well as Christianity, provided they suited his interest; and, if Doctor Rantum, whom he should not trouble his head about, did not chuse to prove himself a proper christian, the quality of heathen or publican must of consequence sit full as easy upon him as that of a christian." - My father replied, that he made no doubt of what the parson said; that it was best not to trouble one's self about reclaiming a fool or a knave, the task being too difficult; but that at all events he would have him break the ice, and ask at least why the pious doctor</p>
            <pb n="58" xml:id="pb-58" facs="#i64"/>
            <p>adopted the Pagan diis manibus <note>Latin</note> to crown his monumental inscription.</p> <p>Doctor Rantum had now just finished his bum-bit, and unless he made a motion for cutting out another, he might be supposed to be at leisure to answer nay fair question. As he made no motion that way, but only wiped his mouth and drank, the parson indirectly, as it were, made a * dissertation on the dii manes, and</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* The souls of the dead were generally called dii manes. It was believed, as may be seen by the testimony of Pagan writers, that the souls of the good became lares or domestic gods; and the souls of the wicked larves, or lemures, that is, spiteful and troublesome demons. But as indeed it could not be known of what sort these souls were, they were all called manes, which signified good. - Consult Vossius in his Etymologies of the Latin tongue, where he has collected all that antiquity has said on this subject. However, it may rather be thought that manes is not a word of Greek derivation, as the far greater number of Latin words are, but that it comes from the oriental root <note>Hebrew</note> ×'× moun, whence is derived ×ª××× × thmounan, which signifies an image, a resemblance; so that the manes will be the same as the ÎµÎ¯Î´ÏÎ»Î± <note>Greek</note> simulachra mortuorum, or the shades of the dead. Lucan also seems to make a distinction between manes and the souls of the dead, in his 8th book,</p> <p> - Manes animamque potextem</p> <p>Officiis averte meis.</p>
            <pb n="59" xml:id="pb-59" facs="#i65"/>
            <p>in the winding up insinuated that it was too antique to be prefixed, under the sanction of the laws established, to any monument, since the Christian aera took place. - "I understood you, Sir, said Doctor Rantum; it is fashionable, and you know it, even among the dignified clergy, though they get by Christianity, to abolish it as much as in them lies. I am never the last in shewing an example; so that if it be expedient to abolish Christianity effectually, I may as well have the honour of doing it by an ouvert act, as others by clandestine practices."</p> <p>There was nothing in either the parson's insinuation, or Doctor Rantum's repartee, that gave my father the satisfaction he desired. He was going to argue the case himself in defence of Christianity, when the coming in of my uncle Dick, (who had been down to the kitchen, with the last dish and the concluding apples) drew the company's attention so powerfully to the bustle he made, and to see what he had got, that my father was left</p>
            <pb n="60" xml:id="pb-60" facs="#i66"/>
            <p>to ruminate within himself on his refutation of Doctor Rantum's Pagan notions.</p> <p>CHAP. VIII.</p> <p>"GENTLEMEN, (said my uncle Dick) sitting down to table again; I hope you all liked my Porcus Trojanus. <note>Latin</note> I told you I would feast you on something more than a rarity; on a dish, neither you nor your fathers before you, ever saw: - I will not say that they never heard of such a dish; its former existence is recorded in history, and tho' not the thing itself, yet a faint resemblance of it has appeared in our days in the suppositums of barbacued hogs and Westphalian bears. - The latter, as an exotic animal, was not introduced, it is thought, to English tables, without some political view, some reasons of state, interpreted by those who only smelt out the feast, in a malevolent sense; but in a sense very beneficent by the bear-eaters themselves."</p>
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i67"/>
            <p>"Pshaw, (said my father, interrupting my uncle Dick;) what a beating about the bush is this? If you want to say any thing about the Westphalian bear; tell, if you know, who imported it, who pampered it, who slayed it, who cooked it, who eat it. Where is the signification of teizing the company's curiosity, or folding up in enigmatic paraphrase, any occurrence which none but slaves would think it treasonable to mention?"</p> <p>'What you say is very right, (replied my uncle Dick;) and a word to the wise being enough, the good company here may take it for granted, that Sir Trimalchio de Bons-Morceaux having by some slight of hand procured a Westphalian bear, kept it snug with him, during the forty days of Lent, in his bed-chamber, where with his own hands he bled it once in eight and forty hours, and fed it one day with almonds and new milk; and the next, with plumb-pudding, cheese-cakes and custard. By thus frequently phlebotomizing the creature, and yet supplying it with new</p>
            <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i68"/>
            <p>sanguisicative resources; he flattered himself that all its former acquired rankness would be dissipated: if so, there was good reason to believe, pursuant to the opinion of the physicians he advised with, that it would be nicely fitted to English stomachs; and the rather, as the consistence and qualities of its flesh must be assimilated, in virtue of the aliments, to that of English children, who of all things, delight most in pudding-diet, and are found to thrive on it."</p> <p>"To make my story short, the bear was jugulated by Trimalchio, - who also affected to have that honour - on Easter-eve. The belly was stuffed full of such ingredients as are commonly used for the making of mince-pyes, with this exception, that the entrails of the brute minced as small as small could be, were mixed up with them. The roasting process was begun by caseing poor Bruin all over in tin, a huge spit, in order to maintain the greater stability in the gyration, being first forced through the skull, neck, and</p>
            <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i69"/>
            <p>vertebrae above the anus: and this same process was put in execution, between two fires, the one in a long range, as is usual in kitchens where a deal of cooking is kept going on; the other in a large parallelogrammic German stove, made and kept red hot by the quantity of fuel it was constantly supplied with. Trimalchio's cooks never before had such warm work to go through with. It might seem as if they were dressing victuals for Belzebub; so copious were the rivulets of sweat that flowed down to their heels. They were all so far naked that they had nothing on but slippers and flannel petticoats; but to compensate their losses from so sensible a perspiration, they drank very plentifully of Old Hock, and the arch cook in particular, much superior in the three dimensions to her brother bear, now in great roasting forwardness, swilled down so many bottles, that the liquor was seen at length to percolate through her pores, the self-same in colour, but of a saline taste, as the scullion, who was curious enough</p>
            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i70"/>
            <p>taste it on the tip of her finger, afterwards reported."</p> <p>"When the beast was roasted, a task, perhaps a degree or two warmer, remained to be done. This was to make red hot all the pokers and fire-shovels in the house to toast the epidermis the moment after the thick hide should be peeled off. Imagine an oblong marble table, for such there was; well aired by inclination at the backside of the German stove, to prevent its otherwise inherent cold and damps from palling the roasted bear whilst stretched on it during excoriation. Taking up from the fire, unspitting and uncaseing were also difficult jobs; but they were performed by half a dozen Irish chairmen within call; the cooks and scullions, some standing a-loof at the same time, and others in the coal-hole, to hide their nudity. - The chairmen having evacuated the kitchen with as much modesty and decency as they entered, the cooks in a minute crouded about the marble table, and each with a sharp-pointed knife scarified and pulled</p>
            <pb n="65" xml:id="pb-65" facs="#i71"/>
            <p>away the skin. What a blowing and shaking there was of scalded fingers by the fat and juices still in a sort of roasting movement, and how they damned the poor Westphalian for it, as if he was in a state of sensibility to retaliate the tortures he was put to? - Anon, the pokers and fire-shovels were brandished over him: no pope, pretender, or devil could go thro' such a fiery trial, such a thorough singeing from the aggregately officious hands of surly whigs, when on the fifth day of the eleventh month they commemorate a conspiracy, the pure creation of malicious chymeras, but tack to it a real one, with the specious appellation of Aur-n deliverance from babylonish captivity."</p> <p>"The toasting was over: a warning-bell was rung. The bear-eaters, that is, those appointed for consuming the bear, took their seats at table. Trimalchio began to bite his nails as if he had been already actually engaged in the act of bear-biting. A silver dish, or rather trough, with six handles, and manufactured for the purpose,</p>
            <pb n="66" xml:id="pb-66" facs="#i72"/>
            <p>was dispatched down to the kitchen. Six lusty footmen shoved the bear into it from off the marble table, and fixed him in a standing attitude. The same footmen, not without a mighty exertion of strength, hauled him up stairs to the dinning-room. With much ado, tho' by the additional struggles of four others, he was raised on the table, which groaned with a creeking stridor under so enormous a bulk, as Charon's boat under the pious AEneas, judged at that time to be as ponderous in grace as all the Methodo-Presby-Antinomian teachers in Christendom. Trimalchio seeing him safe and settled, drew his sword forthwith and knighted him. This prerogative, he hoped, it would be allowed him to assume, as by it he neither intended to derogate from, nor abrogate that of majesty, being only desirous to confer honour on a kindred brute animal, which he had naturalized by English food, and which therefore in quality of Denizen the laws could make no exception against; and if they did, it would only raise a hue</p>
            <pb n="67" xml:id="pb-67" facs="#i73"/>
            <p>and cry, which he did not care a button about; witness the clamours against the Jew-act; he heard them and did not mind them; nay, if he had been the chief machinist of three hundred and sixty-five such naturalizations, and all cried down by the mobility, the whole would not rob him of a night's rest, nor make him feel the least remorse of conscience."</p> <p>"Trimalchio's speech, which he puffed out, as if he had plumbs in his mouth, or rather like an old woman mumbling a crust, and at the same time jabbering something to her cronies about a sad disaster she had a few minutes before in bepissing her stockings, was received by the company with a look tripartite, of curiosity, pleasure, and amazement. But this look, all and every visual ray of it, was directed at acute angles on the beknighted bear, and not even a mathematical point of it centered in Trimalchio's forehead. - The look was curious; it could not be other-wise. - All know the extreme curiosity of the English. What others would not</p>
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i74"/>
            <p>go the length of their nose to see, or spend a farthing to see, they go miles, and fool away guineas. A lady of quality will tell you that she has been at Georgia; that she played there at Putt with St. George; that before George the game was vastly pretty; that St. George afterwards, for the love of her, fought and killed over again the fiery dragon; and that he assured her at parting all the ladies in England should soon wear Georges upon their stomachers." - Here my father again interupted my uncle Dick, praying him to avoid prolixity in a story which could be told in a dozen words. My uncle Dick nodded condescension to him, and omitting a further explanation of the tripartite look on the bear, said, that this look was followed, when it was almost spent, with the words 'Hail Sir Bruin,' which having passed round with alacrity, they all in a Harpeyan strain began to disfigure his knightship, not forgetting to make good use of the sauces appropriated to him, which, besides the belly-contents, consisted</p>
            <pb n="69" xml:id="pb-69" facs="#i75"/>
            <p>of a rich gravy, extracted from one thousand, seven hundred and sixty-one legs of mutton, and an accumulated dish of sour crud. Trimalchio slept well that night, save that, which was rather a pleasure to him,</p> <p>He eat in dreams the Bruin of the day."</p> <p>DUNCIAD.</p> <p>CHAP. IX.</p> <p>IT is a pity my uncle Dick suffered himself to be abridged in his story. If he was let to go on his own way, tho' I must say some of his circumstances were idle, especially the diaphoretic pickle he described the cooks in, - he would have illustrated the political intention of eating a Westphalian bear preferably to other alien food. - I find in his memoirs, where the recital of facts, together with my uncle Dick's own annotations and scholia on them, take up above seventy folio pages, that no malevolent sense could be picked out</p>

            <p>of this bear-feast, as alluding to, or expressive of the nature of a calf's-head feast on the 30th of January: but that the sense, as hinted in the beginning of the foregoing chapter, was properly, peculiarly and immediately significative of emoluments to the bear-eaters themselves: for as Trimalchio passed an act of denization in the bear's favour, that is, infranchised him by his own charter, and also conferred the honour of knighthood on him, he had some foundation to presume, that such flagrant testimonies of affection, receiving the finishing stroke from the incorporating of the brute with his own body politic, and the bodies politic of his adherents, would convince the incredulous world, that so far from being frenchified, both he and they, namely, the said Trimalchio and his said adherents were connected with nothing, were devoted to nothing, were studious about nothing, but the interests of the said bear's native country. - But all these transactions, as equally foreign to us and our subject, I</p>

            <p>shall from henceforth bury in oblivion. Our own symposion, notwithstanding its Roman taste, is more natural to us. I shall therefore resume the remaining part of it. Perhaps the specimens of my uncle Dick's ingenuity will be no less notable in it, than in his Porcus Trojanus. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>CHAP. X.</p> <p>WHAT my uncle Dick had laid upon the table when he came up from the kitchen, was a dish with a raw liver in it, and a dish of apples. The liver was pretty near as big as the liver of a good sizeable calf. The guests almost stared their eyes out at it, but none of them dared to find fault, or to ask why it was served up raw, and whether it was to be eat so, remembering the error they were led into by the Squire in regard to the unexenteration of the Porcus Trojanus. <note>Latin</note> All were still and quiet, as quiet, as resigned, as passive to receive instruction, as any new-born</p>

            <p>modern female saint, to open her purse to her guide in the spirit. My uncle Dick observing them in this tractable disposition, spoke as follows.</p> <p>"Gentlemen, you see here the real liver of a goose." - "Of a goose! (said Doctor Rantum, interrupting him;) astonishing! it can't be so; I would lay a thousand pounds, it is rather the real liver of a sheep." - 'Of a sheep! (said the Squire, turning to the parson;) d-m-n me then, if I'll eat a bit of it. Do you know I had like to be poisoned by break-fasting at five o'clock, one morning, with a soldier and Hackney coachman, in a cellar, on a mess of pease-porridge and a sheep's liver, leaping with flounders: if I ever dive into such a hole again and upon such an errand, may I be hanged an hour after. - 'You would lose your money, (said Doctor Black0beard, directing his discourse to Doctor Rantum,) if you laid that it was a sheep's liver: examine the form of the lobe; you will find a great difference, yet, with all my</p>
            <pb n="73" xml:id="pb-73" facs="#i79"/>
            <p>skill in Anatomy, the colour puzzles me.' - 'Whatever liver it is, (said Doctor Blue-beard,) whether of a fish or quadruped, it will be very unwholsome to eat it raw.' - 'What a parcel of goose-caps are here! - I ask pardon, Gentlemen, for this liberty (said my uncle Dick;) I tell you again it is a goose's liver; the liver of a biped, and not of a fish, or quadruped. Say no more about it. Does not Horace, Martial, Juvenal, mention such a dainty? And Martial says, he had seen it * bigger than the very goose it had been taken from. If you are curious to know how an overgrown liver was procured in a goose, nay, even in a hog, or any other animal, whose livers are delicate eating, you must dip a little into the â  books of antient cookery. I have produced the liver</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Aspice quam tumeat magno jecur ansere majus. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>â  Our people, says Pliny, must have had a good taste for life, if for no other reason than their being acquainted with the excellency of a goose's liver. It grows to an extraordinary size by cramming the goose with a peculiar sort of pellet; and when extracted,</p>
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i80"/>
            <p>raw, not that I designed you should eat it so, as Doctor Blue-beard apprehended, but</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>is it still increased by a mixture of milk and honey. Scipio Metellus, <note>Latin</note> a man of consular dignity, or his contemporary Marcus Sejus, a Roman knight, was reputed the first inventor of this dainty. The method of procuring it is shewn by Palladius. Thirty days are required for fattening, and in order to make the liver tender, pound dry figs, and having macerated them in water, make them into small pellets; with these and nothing else feed the geese for twenty days, and give them water to drink during the same time, in which the wild radish, or sow-thistle, dry and cut into small slices, has been infused. Some, both to make the liver large and the goose fat, conduct the regimen thus. Having cooped up the goose, they feed it with macerated wheat or barley: wheat soon fattens it; barley makes its flesh white. Of each, or both together, they give seven pellets twice a day for the first five days, and then encrease every day the number till thirty days are expired. The four following days is administred a warm decoction of marsh-mallows, with fermented dough; and after-wards, till sixty days are completed, water mixed with honey, and dried figs pounded with the fermented dough. Then the goose and its liver are supposed to be sufficiently pampered. When the liver is taken out, it ought to be washed with warm water, then put into a large bowl with a mixture of warm milk and honey, which it would be advisable to change every two hours, during the time of impregnation. The length of this time is not fixed,</p>
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i81"/>
            <p>that it might be seen what a fine, large, plump and sound one it is. You cannot imagine what a nice taste it has, broiled or fryed. - Let me see; I'll both broil and fry it for you this moment on the table, not by the heat of any earthly combustible; for that would be too mean and common for an exquisite morsel, worthy of the tooth of the greatest kinds and emperors; but by the beams of the sun. - The sun now is on that window; - (pointing to a window backwards of himself</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>and therefore at every one's discretion; but it need not exceed eight and forty hours. Lastly, the liver is laid on a marble stone, or in some cool place, that it may acquire a due consistence and solidity. The carcases and livers of the females are best; and the most proper age is from two to four. Athenaeus writes, that a goose's liver was the favourite dish, the most celebrated, and reckoned the most delicate that graced the coena of the most opulent at Rome. Being prepared int he above manner, no other cookery was used for it than seasoning it with spice, and frying it with the goose's fat.</p> <p>The liver of swine, as may be seen by the testimony of Aristotle, Apicius, Aáº½tius, and Galen, was pampered much in the same manner, but not so frequently, by reason of the great expence that attended feeding hogs with figs.</p>

            <p>as he sat.) - - - You shall be all witnesses of its obsequiousness for promptly dressing the goose's liver by a much brisker fire in proportion than that which roasted the Westphalian bear.'</p> <p>What could any of the guests reply? What doubts could they make? Here were events promised, and too extraordinary to be believed without an ocular demonstration: yet the point was not contested; my uncle Dick seemed too peremptory and earnest to leave it questionable; and tho' there might be a latent diffidence of the execution, it was notwithstanding hoped, as being of his contrivance, that it would succeed.</p> <p>The first thing he did was to take a gallipot of unguent out of his pocket. He handed it round to be smelled to. All declared that it was an aromatic, fragrant, reviving essence. He told them it was nothing more than goose-grease, but that he had purified and exalted it by a perfume of his own invention, which they need not blame him for keeping a secret from them.</p>
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i83"/>
            <p>Of this unguent he emptied the better part out into a stone dish, which he said was proof against heat. Afterwards, searching his pockets, he drew out a glass, and placing it between the rays of the sun and dish, a blaze gush'd out of it, and the unguent, in an instant, began to hiss, and bubble, and boil. The liver was put into the dish, and in a quarter of a minute turned. The glass was nimbly agitated over the turned side, and boiling liquor, during another quarter of a minute, and then the whole was perfectly broiled and fried; so that half a minute did the business. My uncle Dick, distributing to the gentlemen their quota, with a little of the unguent for sauce, bade them not be amazed at the efficacy of his glass: for that he was well acquainted with the art of making the true specula ustoria, <note>Latin</note> or * burning</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* It appears from history, that there were such burning specula. The invention of the parabolic section, which set things on fire at a considerable distance, is attributed to Archimedes. Zonaras writes in the third volume of his history, that Vitalianus the</p>
            <pb n="78" xml:id="pb-78" facs="#i84"/>
            <p> -glasses, which none but himself, and two or three others, had ever brought to perfection; that for his part it should be kept an impenetrable secret by him, as it was by the honourable Robert Boyle, by</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>Thracian, having, in the reign of the emperor Anastasius, excited the Mysians and Cythians to rebellion, and having with a powerful army by land ravaged the Country about Constantinople, and laid siege by sea to the city himself in person with a great naval armament, was opposed by the Praefect Matian, who engaging him in a sea-fight, his fleet was destroyed chiefly by means of a machine constructed by Proclus. This Proclus was an excellent mathematician and philosopher, and had not only a thorough knowledge of all the mechanic powers and inventions of Archimedes, but had also made some new discoveries himself. The specula of his making were of brass, and being suspended on a wall opposite the enemy's fleet, the moment the rays of the sun fell upon them, fire like thunder burst out, and consumed the shipping. The same destruction, as Dion relates, was made of the Roman fleet by Archimedes, when Marcellus besieged Syracuse. It is said of the Hon. Robert Boyle, Esq; that he was not unacquainted with the art of constructing these specula, and that having made the experiment of their prompt efficacy in raising a conflagration, he broke and demolished his instrument, that mankind should not derive from him a knowledge, which, he was sure, in the malice of their hearts, they would apply for their mutual annoyance. It was,</p>
            <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i85"/>
            <p>reason of the pernicious effects to mankind its use would be attended with; and he believed, that Fryar Bacon, a person remarkable for his humanity, would never have made any one privy to a repetition of his experiment on the combined force of sulphur, fire and saltpetre, or tartar, was he sensible at the same time, that some minds would be so bent upon evil, as to make it instrumental to havock and destruction, in the way of gun-powder, and the perfecting of artillery.</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>no doubt, with the same humane intention, my uncle Dick designed to keep the materials and formation of his most powerful speculum a secret, but he was often heard to say, that it far surpassed all other inventions of the kind, that it did not set on fire at ten, twenty, a hundred, or a thousand paces, or at a determinate distance, but at a distance scarce credible unless seen; that it did not fire in a cone, where the rays come together, but that the burning line, which could be made at discretion of any length, proceeded from the center, and burned every thing in its way; and further that it burned before, behind and on all sides.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XI.</p> <p>THE instant my uncle Dick had done speaking, loud acclamations of joy and admiration were heard from every guest; for every guest was joyous, that my uncle Dick had refected their mandibles with new masticatory powers for ruminating the tid-bit of the goose's liver; and every guest had reason to admire the wonderful wonder of wonders he had wrought with his glass in the cooking part. This was not all: every guest presented him, not collectively, but singly, and in his own words, with a cordial address; first, thanking him in the most obliging terms for brightning their taste for cheer, worthy to all intents and purposes of being chiefly displayed at a coronation feast; and secondly, congratulating him for his accession to the perfecting of the arts of ancient cookery, together with the art of roasting victuals with celestial fire; for which,</p>
            <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i87"/>
            <p>they did not wish him the condemnation of Prometheus; that a vulture should continually gnaw and gobble up his liver in Hell; but that a place hereafter might be assigned him, and a pension to support it, in the Zenith of the moon, where, all degrees of persons ascending from the Nadir, whether downright natives of the land, or only fortuitous, - being dropt upon it by some sturdy Goth or Vandal, as beggards often palm their brats upon the parish, - may be accommodated by him with Trojan hogs, and over-grown goose-livers, all piping hot and ready roasted by the speculum ustorium; <note>Latin</note> and of which they may be permitted to eat, till their fancies, picking up some lucid intervals by the diet, take wing, and waft them to the planet Mercury, in whose disk they are to dance about for ever after in mickle mirth and glee.</p> <p>My uncle Dick, in answer, thanked them for their good opinion of his capacity, and their good wishes for his future promotion to so exalted a post in the lunar</p>
            <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i88"/>
            <p>regions; but hoped they were not sincere in their wish. If they were, he thought it his duty to tell them, that he should from his heart decline the elevation, not chusing, if he could help it, to be a drudge in the other world; and that for their pains of wishing, since they had no better wish to felicitate him with, he would wish them in his turn all to hell.</p> <p>What a consternation damped the spirits, and chilled the blood to a sort of stagnation, of the greater part of the guests, when my uncle Dick's wish, which he pronounced angrily, vibrated upon their auditory nerves! The Squire, whether he was afraid himself of being wished to hell, or that he was archly willing to aggravate the fear of some others, whom he could remark to be terribly scared by so dismal a prospect, elbowed the parson, whose attention being turned to what he had to offer, "harkee," (said he, with a whisper loud enough to be heard in every corner of the room;) "don't you think that uncle Dick is the devil? He has said and done</p>
            <pb n="83" xml:id="pb-83" facs="#i89"/>
            <p>such devilish things, that d-mn me, if I can believe that he is any thing else. Bye and bye, we shall take a trip, you'll see, with him to hell. - Off we go in a flash of fire! - Look, see if he has not got a cloven foot; examine the shape of his shoe." - My uncle Dick, winking to my father, and sitting very demure with folded arms and hands touching his shoulders, resolved to wait the upshot of all the deductions he expected would be spun out from the Squire's whisper. - "Aye," (said the Parson, humouring the Squire's archness;) "besides his cloven foot, don't you see what saucer eyes he has got? - He is certainly old scratch, or he has old scratch in him. - - - - How glad I now should be, if I had by me some books of exorcism, to lay him, before he bursts forth into a tempestuous whirlwind to sweep us all away with him." - "Oh lack! (said my grandmother, setting her hands a kimbow, and laughing with all her might;) "as well as a cloven foot, and saucer eyes, why did not you remember his tail.</p>
            <pb n="84" xml:id="pb-84" facs="#i90"/>
            <p>Marry! it is not for nothing he wears sailor's breeches: search and you may find the tail to complete Mr. Devil." These ironico-ludicrous speeches were enough to undeceive the rest, if they had a grain of common sense, that my uncle Dick was not the devil. However, Doctor Blue-beard, as if suspicious of something more than ordinary, stole some frightful side looks at his feet, breeches and eyes, and hinted something concerning the necessity of a search on such occasions, in order to discover a satanical mark. Hence it appeared, that he was not so much apprehensive of the company's having a dealing with the devil in propria personáº­, <note>Latin</note> as with one of his understrappers; and this was further elucidated by the joint opinions of the Doctors Black and Red-beard, who after a little hesitation of speech in motioning the matter, declared with wry faces, that they believed my uncle Dick could be no other than a magician, wizzard, sorcerer, or conjurer; that for aught they knew, their fate might be to be transported</p>
            <pb n="85" xml:id="pb-85" facs="#i91"/>
            <p>upon broom-staffs into some outlandish place, or fairy-land, or enchanted castle; that ten to one they were already at some nocturnal meeting of witches; that none need be surprized at the word nocturnal; - for that the folks who had once signed a compact with three drops of their blood, to be aided in all their machinations by the ministry of one, two, or more familiar spirits, could turn darkness into light and vice versa; could make the moon come down from the heavens and dance on a pewter-platter; could turn the stars backward in their courses; could make rivers flow up to their fountain-heads; could make ropes of the sands of the sea; could turn men into stocks, stones, rats, wolves; in fine, could play a thousand pranks over and over again upon every thing and person they owed a grudge to; - that the consequence of their being at a nocturnal meeting of wizzards and witches, - which, indeed, was more than probable from the out-of-the-way dishes they had eaten of, - would soon</p>

            <p>perhaps manifest itself in the hideous yellings, howlings, and caterwaulings of imps, sprites, and hobgoblins, to which would succeed the dreary prospect of some horrid wild, or of rugged cliffs and precipices, where they should clamber, or stroll about irremeably under the shadow of grim death.</p> <p>What a dreadful imagery was here! how gloomy and how ghastly! and how instantaneous in producing surprizing effects! The Doctors Black and Red-beard seemed as circumvented by all the horrors and spectres they had painted. Doctor Blue-beard, forced, as it were, into a kind of sympathy with his brotherhood, had drips of sweat tumbling down each side his nose as big and as round as marrow-fat peas, or rather like the tears shed by the * horse in Virgil, when he walked as â  chief mourner in his master's funeral procession. My grandmother, mother, aunt</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Guttisque humectat grandibus ora. <note>Latin</note></p> <p>â  By chief mourner is meant, that the horse wept more copiously than any of the rest.</p>
            <pb n="87" xml:id="pb-87" facs="#i93"/>
            <p>Dinah, and sister Betsey, before so full of jokes and laughing among themselves at my uncle Dick's being thought the devil, - who would believe it? - But weak minds and womanish minds are very susceptible of such impressions: - were not so chafed in the imagination, and so terrified by seeing apparitions, by being parties at a nocturnal meeting of witches, by being persuaded from the cogent reasons they heard that my uncle Dick was a sorcerer, that in short, my mother almost fainted away, my grandmother had got into a sweat like Doctor Blue-beard, my aunt Dinah into a cold sweat, and my sister Betsey, rising briskly from her seat, with a beating of her feet on the floor, and a shaking of her hands, cried out, 'For God's sake, save me! Save me from the witches!'</p> <p>"Now, (said my father, imposing his commands on the whole company, to be at peace, to fear nothing, and to be neither fools, nor made fools of;) "now, I see plainly verified the accurate observations</p>
            <pb n="88" xml:id="pb-88" facs="#i94"/>
            <p>of father Mallebranche on the errors of imagination. Stories of the surprizing feats of witches and sorcerers seldom fail to craze weak imaginations, and to such a pitch, that they believe themselves to be what and where they are not. And hence we may account for the mechanical operation of the spirit in enthusiasts of all denominations. A person of a hot imagination, with an earnest tone of voice, a corresponding expression in the eyes and features of the face, a vehement movement by fits and starts of the aptest parts of the body for gesticulation, will forcibly take possession of the minds of his hearers; and after this possession they cannot resist the impulse of being worked up into a full persuasion of the truth of his sentiments. Hereupon, follow groanings and wailings; palpitations and tremors, and sometimes the convulsive hiccup, or singultus <note>Latin</note>observed in Quakers, together with sour eructations, nauseas in the stomach, and a wringing of the intestines; all which produce the vapours of troubled brains and distempered</p>
            <pb n="89" xml:id="pb-89" facs="#i95"/>
            <p>judgments, and these vapours a religious phrensy nor are the effects of ebullient imagination visible only in enthusiasts; its action frequently operates upon the common occurrences of life, and so as to influence them according to the biass of that judgment it has set up. Thus men of good parts and sound intellects have been sometimes imposed upon, and not only imposed upon, but led into fatal delusions. It was an instance of great wisdom int eh Athenians not to have permitted in their deliberative and judicial debates the raising of the passions. Cool and sober reason; a plain, unaffected and unadorned state of the case, were all that was necessary. men could not then form their decisions by the prejudices of others; facts and circumstances evincing truth were alone to direct them. - We should do well if we were always on our guard against the seductions of a busy, wild and extravagant imagination; nothing but such a temper can create the existence of witches and wizzards, with all the other sorts of infatuation</p>
            <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i96"/>
            <p>the silly multitude so unwittily give into. In this disposition of mind, and no other, we should be sensible that we are rational beings, and therefore authorized to reject with contempt whatever is not of eternal truth, or grounded on moral or physical certainty."</p> <p>My father's discourse seemed to impress, as it were, stigmates of shame on the countenances of the medicinal tribe, whilst to the womens hearts it was a reviving cordial. My uncle Dick, who could not help being vexed to hear such a descanting on his person and science, threatened, by the wrinkling of his nose and biting of his lips, to let fly that instant some severe reprimand, especially on the physicians; for it was at them his looks were pointed: - He would have done so, had not Doctor Rantum pushed in his talk before him, alledging with a composed gravity which shewed he was in earnest, "that it was true he was a little shocked at what he heard, but not a bit afraid; that the devil or any of his agents had</p>
            <pb n="91" xml:id="pb-91" facs="#i97"/>
            <p>no power over him; for that he was sure to go to heaven; - aye, sure; (continued he,) as sure as I am here; and if any, or all of ye, have a mind to take the journey along with me, I have a provision at command of a sufficient number of beasts of burden." - My aunt Dinah being curious to know what those beasts of burden were, asked him if they were his fellow teachers and preachers, or if he had hired from the east a parcel of drome-daries and camels? - "Neither, madam, (replied the doctor,) are the beasts of burden I have thought meet to use of this occasion. My neighbour Doctor Scarum and I, who in some points of faith and discipline could not intirely chime with each other, have notwithstanding agreed in this, that we have instituted a seminary of asses at almost an equi-distance between our T-b--n--les near M--rf---ds. There the pretty creatures are maintained at our joint expence, and fitted for the great work of their ministry. When any of our saints expire; - those, I mean, who dealt well</p>
            <pb n="92" xml:id="pb-92" facs="#i98"/>
            <p>with us by delivering up their All for our dispensation: for without this condition not one can be actually sainted, or reputed as fainted among us. - - - We go through a regular lustration of their dead bodies, sprinkling them successively for three days together, morning, noon, and night, with the milk of those asses, and the fourth day, about three o'clock in the morning, he-saints on he-asses, both properly caparisoned. Then a dozen of our lustiest preachers and teachers armed with bellows, perform the sequel of the apotheosis. four taking their stations in the animal's rear, after inserting the nozzle of a large bellows in its anus, work away indefatigably; four do the same down the weazand; and two at the nostrils and two at the ears. you would swear if you was to see the asses thus puffed up with blasts and counter-blasts; - - - - but no profane person is ever permitted to see the sight: - - - that they were transformed into wool-packs. The moment they become lighter than an equal</p>
            <pb n="93" xml:id="pb-93" facs="#i99"/>
            <p>volume of the air, up they go like feathers, or like any other light body. A puff of the bellows underneath as they are just upon the spring, serves to waft them off with the greater velocity, and they follow invariably the direction they have received, till they come to their journies end. - Now, suppose I had a mind to go to heaven still alive, and that ye all here present still alive, had a mind to keep me company; I believe it would not be amiss, nay even necessary, to have me, like the asses, inflated, and you perflated, like a whistle. My reasons are, because I would have the spirit in me, blown up and dilated to such a pitch, that it might serve us all. Your spirits, dull and good for nothing, must be blown out of you; they are too ponderous, and would undoubtedly slacken the elastic agility of the asses; therefore for you a previous perflation would be highly necessary. Here you see I make no account of the gravity of the body: it will be like a fly on the beam of a coach and six. it is the volatility of</p>
            <pb n="94" xml:id="pb-94" facs="#i100"/>
            <p>the spirit that does every thing. What can be a more sluggish mass than the defunct parts of one of our me-st saints, and yet by the attraction of the spirit, which I send off along with it to ride as postillion, it will run in a perpendicular ascent upwards of a hundred thousand miles an hour? - Doctor Scarum has attempted several experiments in his leisure hours, to send his elect to heaven by electrical shocks. I have already laid a bottle and fowl with him, that he will not succeed. But, I must believe his occult design, in pretending to obtain a sufficient electrical force for dispatching his people out of this world, is intirely to evade the keeping of the asses. He has now two or three times complained of the considerable sums his quota has stood him annually in these fourteen years past. But I intend to make him stick close to his agreement. No beast, in my opinion, suits so well the genius of a me-st as an ass; and whoever doubts that asses are procured and calculated for carrying me-sts to heaven,</p>
            <pb n="95" xml:id="pb-95" facs="#i101"/>
            <p>may see, as I already said, the sign of them planted between the two tab-cles. Doctor Scarum's tab-cle is bounded, as a further emblem of what it is, by a hospital of incurable lunatics; and mine, by a brace of dogs barking at the moon."</p> <p>CHAP. XII.</p> <p>MY uncle Dick, as the good reader has seen, who was likely to be very angry before Doctor Rantum began to hold forth, was insensibly mollified into a sort of forgiveness and forgetfulness of the injury done him, by musing upon the quearness of this system of projectiles into heaven, which had been so mechanically explained, and so methodically illustrated. By way of remark on it, he proposed to the company, some of whom had been laughing, and others grinning at the Doctor's absurdity, that suppose one of the asses blown up like a bladder, and in the act of conveying a me-st to heaven, should</p>

            <p>burst by some accident, what would become of the rider, as then both he and the beast must be heavier than an equal volume of the air or aether? - The Squire was of opinion that they would fall down plumb upon, and break the sky-lights of the T-b-----cle. - This Doctor Rantum denied, saying it was more probable the spirit would return to him with the news of the disaster, but that the bodies of the rider and his ass would be absorbt into the vortex of the nearest planet, or fixed star. - - - 'I conceive,' (said my grandmother,) that the spirit would go along with the bodies, and haunt the place they came to. God send they fall not nay where about our house: I should be frightened out of my wits if I was to see, especially the ghost of an ass.' - My mother, aunt Dinah and sister Betsey, thought my grandmother's opinion more probable than Doctor Rantum's, and wished as she did, if the ass cracked by the way, that he would never come to bray in their ears with the ghastly figure of a me-ist on his</p>

            <p>back. - - - - The parson and my father left the dining-room together when my grandmother was delivering her opinion; so ti was not expected that they should speak to the question. But the question being put to the Doctors Blue, Black and Red-beard, they said it was this, or it may be that: in fine, they said, and said nothing.</p> <p>"Well, (replied my uncle Dick, addressing himself to the physicians,) what fine reasoners! what expert naturalists have we got here! A while ago I was a conjurer; I was the devil; and yet I have done nothing that could not be easily accounted for. In Doctor Rantum's system of a migration to heaven, not one word was spoken to argue its impossibility. An hypothesis that implied a contradiction must destroy itself and all the consequences drawn from it; whereas from a possibility no absurdity can follow. But this is the way, more than three parts of the world are set to grope about in the dark hollow shade of delusive error. A vainly conceited man amidst</p>

            <p>the luxuriance of a fancy fed with chimeras, spins a fine metaphysical or theological cobweb; he gives it the name of a new light; see people run to gape after the novelty of the meteor! And indeed, they follow it close, till it has led them into the pit of perdition, instead of the heaven it bade them to be sure of. - - - - The circumspect man, who holds fast to what is good, with a broom of judgment that can separate truth from falshood, keeps the house of his reason clear both of these metaphysico-theological spiders and their webs. In sweeping them clean away, what does he find in the recesses of their cells, and in the dark lanthorns they pretend their light glares in? After a close and diligent inspection, he can discover nothing, but a crabbed, gloomy and false science, a sense worse than ignorance, and a chaos of idle, frivolous, absurd, ridiculous, and contemptible notions."</p> <p>My uncle Dick would have said more on the invention of new lights, and the new ways and means of going easily to</p>
            <pb n="99" xml:id="pb-99" facs="#i105"/>
            <p>heaven; but he was interrupted by my father and the parson, who entered, saying to one another, "It will do, it will do; yes, it will do very well.' - - - What was this but a large and deep tub two servants had pushed up stairs after them, and rolled into the dinning-room. Some were immediately busy at guessing what was intended by it. The Squire said that it was for scalding Doctor Rantum, or one of the physicians; for that he believed uncle Dick was resolved to make a Trojan hog of one or other of them. The doctors hereupon began to wear indignabund faces; but my father to dispel the gathering storm of altercation, told them plainly that the tub was to serve no other use than that of a substitute for a pulpit or rostrum to preach in; because parson Yorrick was pleased in good nature to acquaint him, that he would preach a sermon for the benefit and edification of the whole company, before the physicians deliberated upon the most effectual method of generating male-children.</p>
            <pb n="100" xml:id="pb-100" facs="#i106"/>
            <p>"Parson Yorrick preach a sermon! (said Doctor Rantum,) Nay, I think I have a better right than any parson in the kingdom to be called upon for executing that office: for who possesses the talents of preaching in a superior degree to me? who has such a forehead of brass? who has such hereantherian eyes, looking ninety-nine ways at once? who can swell his cheeks with boreal blasts to the magnitude I can? what wind or water-mill can have a more flippant and clacking gyration than my tongue? what bellows of iron-work forges have such a suction at inspiration, and such a belching at expiration as my lungs? what bowels can yearn more than mine, to drain the purses of my congregation by their charitable donations? Add to these, the nodding of my head, before, behind, and on each side, and with so much flexibility, that some often imagine I am going to throw it in the people's faces. What shall I say of my shoulders? No Frenchman, his phiz replete with airs of grimace, can have the</p>
            <pb n="101" xml:id="pb-101" facs="#i107"/>
            <p>art of shrugging them up to more advantage than I do, when I form dismal complaints of the slackness of some in contributing their mite. And now for my hands and arms! who will say that I cannot display and expand them with a supple activity? I even sometimes stretch beyond the precepts of oratorial action, and toss, and whirl, and flourish them over my head. Again, who can vye with me in lateral inflexions? or when I find it necessary, who can so aptly keep tune with a vociferation by a sonorous supplosion of the feet? In short, search the world all over, and you will not, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, find such a preacher as I am. - Come, clear the way; - I'll mount the rostrum instead of parson Yorrick, and in less than a quarter of an hour I will drown every soul of you with floods of eloquence."</p> <p>My father begged to be excused, assuring him, that as the tub had been pre-engaged to parson Yorrick, he could not in honour retract his having the use of it;</p>

            <p>that he had two or three times heretofore the patience to hear Doctor Rantum preach, but that he was sorry to observe, a want of connection in most, if not all, of his sentences; a heap of whimsical matter foreign to his purpose introduced; a tautology highly disgusting; a doctrine for the most part unscriptural; arguments either evasive or delusive, and consequently no just conclusion ever drawn, the whole argumentation being often in the taste of "the archbishop of Toledo has just sat down to dinner, therefore I may go sleep."</p> <p>"I preach, (answered Doctor Rantum,) as the spirit giveth me utterance; my eloquence is angelic, and not human." - "This is the first time I ever heard, (replied the Squire) that the angels spoke incoherently: for I am sure, if they speak as you preach, their discourse will be a jumbled jargon of inconsistencies; and to convince the public of it, I will soon have printed word for word two sermons you some time ago preached, the first on mother</p>

They say women have a good hand in the brewing of that British nectar. When we have drank about three glasses a piece, the parson may begin. However, I will not stint him to a number: he may drink also when he pleases in the rostrum. A glass now and then, besides raising his spirits, will mellow his tongue, and clear his pipe.</p>
            <pb n="104" xml:id="pb-104" facs="#i110"/>
            <p>CHAP. XIII.</p> <p>THE punch was well brewed, and some of it drank. The parson made a motion for getting into the tub. The company began to compose themselves for attention. Not a word louder than the whiz of a whisper was heard. The parson was helped into the tub by the two servants that brought it up stairs, but my father thought it unseemly to leave it on a level with the floor. A suitable and firm stand was sought for, and a strong oak-table was pitched upon. All lent a hand to lift the tub with the parson in it on this table. The tub was now looked down with majesty on the auditory: the parson would have looked down also majestically, but his face was not yet to the fore; there was only a prospect of his hinder parts. It seems, he kept himself thus backwards for a few minutes to settle some affairs on his frontispiece. The things were fixed in their stations, and</p>
            <pb n="105" xml:id="pb-105" facs="#i111"/>
            <p>he briskly turned about with a bow of gentle inclination to the company.</p> <p>O marvellous sight! yet a sight not new, nor singular, nor strange, nor shocking, nor frightful; but to some, a sight of pleasure; to others, of shame; to all, of risibility: for all could not help smiling or laughing at the sight, howsoever otherwise they stood affected to countenance, or discountenance it.</p> <p>The gentle reader must be curious to know what this sight consisted of. But I tell him he need not. It was nothing more than what is frequently but too common. The parson could not shew himself to advantage without the appendix of his favourite badge, and perhaps fearful that one would not set a sufficient distinguishing mark on him, he chose to adopt several; not that he made, if you believe him, any interior use of them himself; but that the world might believe he had them in veneration only for the sake of garnishing his outward apparel, and that besides one of his cloth</p>
            <pb n="106" xml:id="pb-106" facs="#i112"/>
            <p>should have the sole honour of being the first that recommended by example so commendable a fashion. However, let none aforehand presume to think he designed to preach on this topic: no; his discourse; as will be seen, was quite a different thing. - But to come to the main point.</p> <p>His forehead was protuberant with * * * *. - I see no necessity for being minute in the description of size and colour? Each cheek had a beauty-spot of * * * *, smaller in proportion than the forehead-piece, but much alike it in colour. His chin had pendant from it * * * * forked in the shape of a Jew's inverted caroty beard. His shoulders were ornamented with knots of * * * *, and, o prodigious! his bosom had * * * *, not a whit inferior to the ursa major, or it might be denominated a bushy-tailed comet, blazing and fiery. This was his breast-plate, or if he should ever be reduced to the necessity of standing a siege, it was to fortify him as a parapet, or banquet, or ravelin, or</p>

            <p>counter-guard, or lunettes, or covert-way, or glacis, together with berms well palisaded and fraised, terre-plain, salient angles, gorges, counterscarps, flanks, casements, embrasures, traverses, polygons, advanced towers, redoubts, bastions and horn-works.</p> <p>It is necessary to inform the reader, that as soon as the parson had brought about this unexpected appearance, my mother, aunt and sister evacuated the place with drums beating and colours flying. As to my grandmother, having no passions that way to be moved, or having as little occasion to have them moved, as a blindman has for a candle to light him to bed, she kept her post undismayed; but to shew that she still made some grains of allowance for modesty, she threw her apron over her face.</p> <p>The parson having now adjusted all his things, was ready to give out his text, when Doctor Rantum suddenly rapt into extasies, broke out, with expanded arms</p>
            <pb n="108" xml:id="pb-108" facs="#i114"/>
            <p>and eyes wistfully fixt on the central point of the parson's bosom, into the following exclamatory rhapsody.</p> <p>"Source of our joy! Balm of human woe! Solace of life! Sweetest of nuts for cracking! Apricot of delicious flavour! Pine-apple of luxuriant pleasure! Fig of exquisite charms! Rose of fragancy! Violet scented with delight!

            <p>and lords had. This must be a fine country, said I to myself, to water with my gospel, to raise fruit in, and int he end to reap a plentiful harvest. In fine, I arrived at Dublin, got soon into the good graves of a rich merchant's wife; she let me have without many pressing solicitations between four and five hundred pounds of her husband's cash: he had taken a journey from home at this time, and left in her care the keys of his compting-house: missing his cash when he came home, having an occasion to pay off some bills, he asked her what became of it. She plainly told him, she had given it to me, the good and holy man! to dispose of in charities; - that it could not be better bestowed, to make him, her husband thrive in his worldly concerns; in short, that it was laying up treasures in heaven: the husband craftily dissembling his wicked purpose, pretended to commend her piety, saying, that charity covered a multitude of sins, that he would be glad to converse with the</p>

            <p>holy man himself, to have the favour of his company the next day to dinner, and that probably he would make a handsome addition to her donation. - The whole affair, as it passed, was punctually recounted to me; I was overjoyed, and did not fail, you may be sure, to come to dinner. - We dined very elegantly; he shewed me a good countenance; I suspected nothing amiss. As a bottle of French wine was pushing about, when the cloth was taken away, he asked me very seriously, his wife present, what money she had given me? I told him, and that disbursed in that manner it would be a certain means to bring them both to heaven. - "Heaven! (replied he, with a sneer and look of contempt at me) I hope to go there without your keeping a farthing of my property to procure me admittance. - Return, I say, my money to me immediately, or I will clap you up fast in Newgate; - there are bailiffs in my house, who shall lay hold of you this instant, and lodge you there." - I was</p>
            <pb n="112" xml:id="pb-112" facs="#i118"/>
            <p>thunderstruck, and the good woman seemed as much astonished as I was. - Recovered a little from my first surprize, I pleaded hard, that as the money was a free gift, it ought not to be returned, and that I would be answerable at the Great Day for the charitable uses it should be put to. All my expostulations were vain; the bailiffs were called in and seized upon me; I had no other resource left then to desire the merchant to come with me to my lodgings, where his demand should be satisfied since he would have it so. I was hurried into a hackney-coach; the whole crew wedged themselves in along with me; the merchant received his money back, and the bailiffs milked me of ten guineas, saying, it was little enough for hush-money. This was not all: the merchant threatened me at parting, that if he heard I remained in the kingdom four and twenty hours longer, he would have me hanged without judge or jury by the populace. Fearing he would be as good as his word; for the</p>

            <p>temper of the Irish is frequently arbitrary, and not to be restrained by laws; I went off that night in the packet-boat for Holyhead, with a firm purpose never to preach any more in Ireland; and ever since I mortally hate the very name of an Irishman and his country. - But as we have got upon the subject of the goodness of women, I will tell you another story about two sisters I was great with in Newfoundland . . . . ."</p> <p>"Pray, Doctor Rantum, (said my father, taking him up short,) let us hear no more of your trash. - I think the Irish merchant served you very right. How can a woman dispose of her husband's substance? And what man but a knave would inveigle her to embezzle it? I wish English husbands were as vigilant to detect and frustrate all pious frauds: if they were, we should constantly have an account of restitution demanded, or your doors beset every day with catchpoles. - I tell you again, let me hear no more of your stuff: I have heard already but too much of it."</p>
            <pb n="114" xml:id="pb-114" facs="#i120"/>
            <p>Doctor Rantum could not digest this severe reprimand. He began to fret, and fume, and storm, and said he would keep company no longer with such a pack of unsociables. My father very bluntly desired him to be gone. Abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit, <note>Latin</note> off he went as surly as you please, and did not speak one word more till he got to the dining-room door, when, by way of farewell, he threatened the whole company with hell-fire, and said he might revenge his cause too, in this life; for that he and Doctor Scarum could raise between them in their several departments a body of sixty thousand combatants.</p> <p>All were glad he was gone, believing they should have no satisfaction in the sermon, if he was suffered to continue at the rate he began. His rodomontades, in spite of fate, would be for breaking out; and what must become of the preacher's discourse amidst such a heap of interruption? - The remaining spirits seemed more tractable, and not so prone to interrupt upon proper warning given them, to</p>
            <pb n="115" xml:id="pb-115" facs="#i121"/>
            <p>bridle their tongues. However, my father, to make void, if possible, all exceptions against the parson or his sermon, requested his reverence to recommit his * * * * to the repository from whence they came, and if he had nothing smutty to say, when those effects were once secreted, himself would call up his wife, sister and daughter, and with them all his domestics. The parson complied, acknowledging that his conscience tender and scrupulous now began to break off his attachment to the badge of * * * *, and that it was bad to scandalize weak brethren, which he would take care never to do again. He assured them he had nothing offensive of chaste ears to offer, and required no other favour than a patient and attentive hearing. Here-upon, the ladies resumed their places, and Tom, John, Nick, Margery, Mary and Nan came gaping in after them. - Nota benÃ©, <note>Italian</note> it will serve no purpose to describe the attitudes and other oratorial airs and graces the parson put himself into and affected before and after he spoke, as follows.</p>
            <pb n="116" xml:id="pb-116" facs="#i122"/>
            <p>CHAP. XIV.</p> <p>ON the poet Gay's monument in Westminster-Abbey, you will find these words cut in black letters,</p> <p>"Life is a jest; and all things shew it; I thought so once, but now I know it."</p> <p>How is life a jest? - Not one in ten thousand will say it is. - Every individual, from the king to the beggar, if they declare their real sentiments, will tell you that they love to live and to live well. - Nay, the archb-p believes it as firmly as his Creed, that it is infinitely better to be a live coal-heaver than a dead minister of state. - Life then is not a jest; that is, living, whereby we understand a power to move the machinery of our bodies, health to invigorate this motion, good cheer to support it, warm cloathing to cherish it, and when the alternative of rest seems requisite, a soft, compact and even bed to wind up its spring with refreshment. - None of these particulars are a</p>
            <pb n="117" xml:id="pb-117" facs="#i123"/>
            <p>jest, neither in, nor by themselves immediately do they afford matter for being jested at; they are all according to nature's prescript, and as such, very good, and of real use.</p> <p>Considering the affair in this light, the inference justly drawn would be, that the poet was mistaken in his assertion of life's being a jest. I dare say he was not. His meaning could be no other, than that the manner of life, and not life itself, is a jest. This must therefore be the hinge whereby the door hangs, which we shall open for admittance to the recesses of whatever is contained in the text; so that, passing in review the several parts, four compleat divisions will muster themselves in exact order; First, that the manner of life is a jest: Secondly, that the far greater number of implements calculated for life shew how ridiculous they make it: Thirdly, that some time or other, we cannot help thinking of the follies and vain pursuits of life: and, Fourthly, that from our own experience we are sensible at last,</p>
            <pb n="118" xml:id="pb-118" facs="#i124"/>
            <p>how much we have jested and have been made jests of. In this point will be particularly discussed, the jester's plan of operations on the jestee, and the measures sometimes adopted by the latter to change his situation, which is nothing else than a retorting of the argument, and making a butt for himself in his turn. - The whole will conclude with an exhortatory peroration, which may obtain its end as much as a great many of the morals subjoined to AEsop's fables, or the Grand Mogul's speech to the Rajahs of the mountains, or the request of a lady of honour to a noble Lord not to be rude with her, or thundering British legions sent at any time to demolish the French in Germany, or laws barely enacted against bribery and corruption, or remonstrances concerning the danger of bankruptcy from the impracticability in process of time of paying the interest of the nation's debt, or the just suit of a family made paupers in Chancery, or complaints against enormous extortions under the decent appellations of fees and</p>
            <pb n="119" xml:id="pb-119" facs="#i125"/>
            <p>perquisites, or piles of ceremonial addresses lifted up in the air on the wings of paper-kites, or in fine, the expostulation of a b-p in a pastoral letter to the clergy of his diocess touching their unhypocritical fervour to give scandal, by a mockery of many of the received religious dogmas, and by being too palpably the carnal and animal man St. Paul speaks of, and therefore little scrupling to card, dice, speak bawdy, drink, smoke and take snuff in public company.</p> <p>That the manner of life is a jest, will be obvious to every one who can be induced to entertain something of a notion, that whilst infinite pains are taken about the body, to embellish it, to pamper it; none, or very little are taken about the soul. The reason is, because the generality in this respect, argue with themselves as Saddusaical Jews. "When we once die, say they, there's an end of us; therefore let us make good use of the present, and enjoy the pleasures we mostly relish. As for the soul, if there be any such thing,</p>
            <pb n="120" xml:id="pb-120" facs="#i126"/>
            <p>we know so little of it, that we rob the more important concerns of the body, of the time we bestow upon it in idle disceptations, and fitting it for improvement by vague conceptions of moral maxims." Hence it is, that the poor soul is made a jest of, all its faculties scoffed at, and its whole substance ridiculed as so insignificant, that it is judged to be one of the lightest things in the world, as light as thistle-down, and therefore of no value in either credits or debits, of little or no account among men, scarce one in twenty thousand caring a rush for it. - I would lay with any one of this good congregation half a dozen of wine and a leash of fowls, that if a soul was offered to any pawn-broker within the bills of mortality, he would not lend a single groat on it, no not even, if this soul was endowed with a full catalogue of all virtues and sciences: for not one of those virtues and sciences nicely weighed in an accurate ballance would amount to the hundred thousandth part of a grain: so the pawn-broker in a</p>
            <pb n="121" xml:id="pb-121" facs="#i127"/>
            <p>jesting mood, would say; and if so, virtue or science would be of no value in his opinion, consequently the soul, the subject of virtue and science, would be worth nothing, or according to our text, the object of a mere jest.</p> <p>It will be next to an impossibility to elucidate how the manner of life is a jest, unless things and persons are introduced; so that the second point, and indeed the third and fourth of the division must take place. - As I was ruminating a few nights ago upon materials to make them out, of which none seemed satisfactory enough to me, I was suddenly seized with a fit of drowsiness. The sight of pen, ink and paper was no longer agreeable. In short, I went to bed, fell asleep, and in a dream, - it is very probable it was nothing else, - I imagined * myself transported to the utmost boundaries of the north, where, according to common report, many things</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* The better part of this sermon, if it can be called a sermon, is an imitation of a Menippean satyr of Heinsius.</p>

            <p>are practised by occult arts, which among the politer sort would scarce be credible.</p> <p>It may be thought an odd jest in me to jumble three points slap-dash into one, and a more odd, if not an astonishing jest, to preach my dreams; but it is what most of my cloth usually do: they even preach dreaming, scarce ever thoroughly awake; and tho' in this manner they are jesting with their matter, and jesting upon their auditors, if you bring them to a sort of resussitation out of their coma somnolentum, by a smart compression of their noses, by the application of an ignited poker to their fundamental parts, by running splinters into the quick under their nails, and by hitting the bone of their elbows a furious knock with an iron bar; they will swear to you on the thirty-nine articles, if you believe them, that they were all the while in earnest. - be it so: but I know some also, who, full as watchful as cats after mice, preach so as to seem cornuted like Sylvanus, or blessed with compleat dimensions of asses ears in the taste of</p>
            <pb n="123" xml:id="pb-123" facs="#i129"/>
            <p>Midas. Propitious Heaven preserve us from the malignant breath of their nostrils! - And now, to make my own apology, if any of the jesting visions I am going to recount, should seem deficient in point of coherency, let it be known to all here present, that it is customary with a sleeper to remit much of his judgment, and not manage things analytically in Hogarth's goÃ»t. The face is not exact, unless conformable to the symmetry of elegance; nor the body, unless justly proportioned. But sleep little regards the preserving of this harmonious excellence: often it misapprehends the form, often the manner, and most commonly confounds the order of time and facts.</p> <p>Now to resume the thread of my discourse. - There was, as it appeared, where I was conveyed, a huge and vastly high rock, which by its lower part, broke the fury of the swelling surges of the sea, but its summit, what I little expected in this Hyperborean region, was variegated with the gayest flowers, and most delightful</p>

            <p>herbage: neither was it destitute of trees, and some evergreen shrubs, which were taught by the curious simplicity of nature to digest themselves into regular confusion, and by their supplely clinging branches to form a diversity of the most pleasing arbours.</p> <p>Whilst charmed by this charming scene, with eager eyes I explored all its beauties, some women advanced full in view. Their conductress was the neatest, prettiest thing I ever saw. I saluted her with a low bow, and to obtain a specimen of her art, which i knew would facilitate the order of the jesting meditations I was musing upon before I went to bed, I took courage, and addressed her in these words. "Thou fairest of all fair, can'st thou not from this exalted place of speculation, exhibit for me in full light, the intire globe of the earth with its inhabitants?" She smiling a smile inexpressibly sweet, and not seeming to require many intreaties, sets about an incantation, and with uncommon rapidity transports me and her attendants to</p>
            <pb n="125" xml:id="pb-125" facs="#i131"/>
            <p>the globe of the moon. Here the moon herself, such as she is described by poets, first meets us, and having given and received pledges of safety, was pleased to favour me with her hand. So soon as I had surveyed her all over with curious looks: "Hail, venerable lady! (said I,) the parent of all scarce-crows, sprites, bug-bears, and dreams; the promotress of all jests, queer humours, and odd fancies: the directress of all schemers, enthusiasts, and whip-sillybub contrivers: the conductress of all feather-heads, scattered-brains, and hare-brains; the vis motrix of all frolics, gambols, vagaries, reveries, deliriums, and phrensies. Hail, I say again, ever revered matron! Tell! O tell me! whether any of our Britons feel the powers of thy gladning influence!" She made no reply, but pointing forwards, and making other signs to follow her, led us to an apartment of her orb, situate to the east, from which I could see not only every particular country and city of the subterjacent earth, but also men, and what</p>
            <pb n="126" xml:id="pb-126" facs="#i132"/>
            <p>each person did, as if really transacted in my presence. My joy was great, thinking I should be made as well informed a contemplant as Charon in Lucian.</p> <p>And, indeed, I could plainly see how the multifarious jests in life were transacted. Some I saw weeping, others laughing; some in a great hurry about doing something, and yet doing nothing; some overjoyed in wedding an agreeable spouse, others as joyful in performing her funeral obsequies. The English and French wished for peace, the petty German princes hated nothing so much; some had an insatiable thirst after riches, and those, I found, were the far greater number: others rioted and debauched away their incomes or acquisitions, or what they suddenly and profusely lavished, they were as eager by new lucrative measures to recover. Thus alike from luxury and poverty, there were always transitions to wishes. Some with a well scented pack of hounds of their own training, were constantly hunting down places or pensions, others tacitly wished</p>
            <pb n="127" xml:id="pb-127" facs="#i133"/>
            <p>that their lives might be prolonged to an hundred years and upwards, and with this proviso, that afterwards they would be satisfied to expire by any sort of fate, tho' ever so ignominious or disastrous. There were not wanting, who by a no less unreasonable wish, coveted to have Gyges's magic ring, by the virtue of which, making themselves, whenever they pleased, invisible, they might at full liberty, play the pranks they mostly delighted in. - The orators of the Robinhood whetted their tongues in detestation of Deism and Arianism, to evince the reasonableness of the Athanasian Creed. The critics, like sooth-sayers, were forming conjectures concerning the extrinsic merit of each contemporary author. With faces averse from these, I could discover the tribe of poets going to bed supperless, whether through their own fault, or that of the times, I shall leave undecided. Coffee-house politicians averred for matter of fact, that certain statesmen were greater knaves than fools, and that stock-jobbers,</p>
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i134"/>
            <p>placemen, the corruptors and the corrupted were as much as ever the mode. Lawyers, according to their wonted custom, a custom never to be unlearned, much less to be forgot by them, sowed the seeds of new suits, and already by hope devoured their clients goods and chattels. Some physicians and apothecaries had many an aching heart, because no epidemical sickness raged: it was not so with the quacks; none of their brows lowred with melancholy; on the contrary, all seemed to pride themselves in the success of their cathartics, drops, powders, pills and sugar-plumbs. As for divines, I had no great inclination to canvas their conduct, well remembering that it is the height of prudence neither to meddle nor make with them. But unless one is conversant with Homer, it will be a difficult task to set this matter in a proper light. We see in his poem how Jupiter with one and the same pair of eyes views different nations, especially the Moguls, Tartars, Laplanders, Samoeids and Hottentots: nothing obstructs</p>
            <pb n="129" xml:id="pb-129" facs="#i135"/>
            <p>his seeing also the chain that binds fast the E-h and some of the G-n territories together, were it not that he did not much chuse it: this was my case with divines: I detest nothing so much as casting in their teeth their strenuous endeavours for promoting and defending the J-w-a-cts; for it is no business of mine to animadvert of them, if at any time by their approbation, even Turks, Arabs and Philistines should be adopted into the rights and privileges of B-s.</p> <p>This diversity of jests, from whatever source they flowed, were then depending on the decision of my judgment. When, therefore, I had collated what I had seen, and made an exact estimation of the whole: "Sure, (said I,) nothing can be more foolish than this world! Yet, this is that which we quit with floods of tears; from which we depart with as much anxiety as if we were going to the gallows; for the sake of which we cannot abide the thoughts of death; out of which sometimes arbitrarily some proud conceited statesman,</p>
            <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i136"/>
            <p>who sees nothing but a saint shadow of dignity, with a visage unaffably composed to severity and gravity, not unlike an old woman over a close-stool, grunting, growling, and grinning to get rid of a hard-bound belly, dispatches a learned and facetious man. This same brow-beater, should he be attacked by a slight indisposition, or should Parca, the best of the Heathenish Goddesses, crack her knuckles over his head, immediately bidding fare-well to all his state-tricks, and at the third sob, for he seldom can fetch more, he extends his rigid heels.</p> <p>Nothing is more certain than the equality which must await all mankind after this life. - Notwithstanding here below, the kings, who boast themselves conquerors, assume faces of haughty arrogance, whilst the conquered have no other consolation left than that of deploring their lamentable situation. This earth is the theatre, the circus, the scene of fate. All silly baubles here some time or other come tumbling into ruins. Boys playing</p>

            <p>at castle-building shew an example of those jests of fortune. They now raise aloft the pile, and now with wanton feet kick it down. Here often one day mocks, but no day consumes the trifling hopes of ambitious courtiers. Life not only deserts them in the height of fruition, but even deceives them before they can reach the end of the designed course.</p> <p>And that it may be permitted me to take for pattern some of our modern authors, who begin in the buskin, and end in the sock; or some others, who are wont to begin an elaborate dissertation on the anatomy of leeks or garlick, but end shamefully in lavish commendations of a petticoat.</p> <p>Here also I saw the most insipid follies; factions concerning politics and religion; an ocean of animosities; strife, sudden hatred, and jealousies; sometimes proposals of peace, but anger finding a second vent in concert with knavish contrivances for subverting the native rights of liberty. - Such a farce, I am certain, was never</p>
            <pb n="132" xml:id="pb-132" facs="#i138"/>
            <p>so well acted by the mimic jesters of Bartholomew-fair.</p> <p>Well fare the heart of mother Nature, who was pleased we should come into the world weeping! We are never indeed less subject to make a jest of truth, than when we begin life with tears; unless Democritus may reduce us to reason, who, when he had extricated his posteriors from the rod at school, and had afterwards seen the world, chose to prefer laughter: for whatever nature has made, wit devised, or opinion recommended to man, cannot rescue itself from contempt.</p> <p>But to return to those possessed with the demon of ambition. Not one of this tribe of sycophants, whom I accurately observed, but hoped for something of a very extraordinary nature, which when obtained, like a beggar sent packing from a door with an alms, yet, as if his pouch was never lined with a crust, he again fatigued Heaven, troublesome to others, and seemingly a burden to himself. Not one also was furnished with such a stock</p>
            <pb n="133" xml:id="pb-133" facs="#i139"/>
            <p>of human prudence, or was so conversant with life, as not to turn out often the dupe of his own artifice. Sometimes good political views were defeated by the pleasing interposition of money, to which it is a very fruitless endeavour to oppose judgment or cunning, much less probity.</p> <p>In the mean time, as certain things appeared not sufficiently, my conductress from the region beyond the polar circle, drew out of her bosom a microscopic pair of spectacles, which she said would discover the most minute particle in very distant objects. I soon learned from her the manner of seeing through them, and the moment I plyed my eyes with them in order to discover the singularities of the manner of jesting in the multiplicity of objects that presented themselves: "Heavens! (cried I,) to what absurdities are superfluities in apparel and equipage grown to? What flagrant testimonies of fooling away national wealth do I see in legible characters on the books of all the state offices? How monstrous are the shapes of luxurious</p>
            <pb n="134" xml:id="pb-134" facs="#i140"/>
            <p>living? But such jests are become the fashion: there is no stemming the tide of them: clocks and watches will stand still, before luxury ceases in a great city, when once it has passed into example, and gathered strength from emulation."</p> <p>"It was this, thou charmer, (said I, turning to my conductress;) it was these gaudy notions that prevailed on our English ladies to despise their neat simplicity in apparel, and recommend themselves in French airs to the addresses of every flaunting empty-skull'd coxcomb. May the genii, guardians of liberty, grant, that the contagion of this infamy spread not over the nation, and that English women in some years hence, conceive not and be delivered of those they imitate!"</p> <p>But what, O fair one! (added I,) are those nice, delicate, pretty things that flutter about in yon corner like versicolour butterflies?" "They are virgins, (answered she,) or rather they pass for such. Put on your spectacles, and you will see with what gayety they jest, sport, laugh, ogle and</p>
            <pb n="135" xml:id="pb-135" facs="#i141"/>
            <p>make assignations with their gallants. If any of them chance to embrace the matrimonial state, about which they are very indifferent, it generally happens that their husbands foreheads, like an abscess, gather into a point, of which phenomenon you may read some anecdotes, in a future edition of mother Shipton's prophecies. In the state of virginity, they usually make choice of one, to whom they send an off-spring as his own. The real father, for memory divided amongst so great a multitude must often be embarassed, lurks modestly concealed; or if called in question, he answers, so dubious an affair cannot be well cleared up. It was but lately, that a certain fair nymph, a few weeks after her espousals, and pretty early in the morning, began to make a few complaints of the gripes. The same day her pains encreasing in so manifest a manner, as to declare what they portended; the physician called for, no ill man in the main, but as many of the brotherhood, a novice at his art, and</p>

            <p>whose discerning faculties required to be hammered out a-new on the Diagnostic anvil, pronounced in terms scientific, that poor madam was grievously afflicted with the tympanites dropsy. He prescribed accordingly; but a midwife in half an hour after radically cured the malady. It was the papa's own child, as like him as two eggs each other. None pretended to dispute the truth. It had some resemblance of man, a common animal in this world, but not much thanked, especially when born contrary to the father's expectation."</p> <p>"I am not astonished, (replied I;) foreign manners have infected our sanctity. lewdness is authorized among us by the specious appellations of innocent gallantry and delicate refinement in love. What now is become of our ancient simplicity? sweet simplicity! How I wish to see thee in thy native modesty. - Then rolling earnestly my eyes in all directions, I poured out a supplication in the following strain,</p>
            <pb n="137" xml:id="pb-137" facs="#i143"/>
            <p>which favoured much, as I then thought, of Homer's spirit.</p> <note>Latin</note> <p>Pulchra Ã´ simplicitas! beata virgo!</p> <p>Tu vincis radios nitore Phoebes,</p> <p>Tu stellas superas decore cunctas. â </p> <p>"Thou purest of virgins, O simplicity! Thy beauties excel the beauties of the most beautiful lily. Under thy benign protection the earth was formerly safe. Love, probity and faith influenced by thee, reigned in the hearts of mankind. Frauds, even the suspicion of frauds, by the aweful majesty of thy brow, fled afrighted into unknown climes. Thou alone dost impart to thy votaries secure minds, sincere breasts, and the great depositum of unconscious guilt. In whatever tract of the world, thou hast secluded thyself from mortal eyes; thou, who wast once the pride and glory of Britons, whether luxury, or the anxious madness of possessing, or ambition the parent of falsehood, have by degrees</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>â  Dr. More's Minocardia.</p>

            <p>sullied thy ancient splendor, O virgin! once more shew the charms of thy gladning countenance, and propitiously regard the prayers of thy suppliant."</p> <p>When I had put an end to this prayer, I gave a spring to my body, and catching hold of the branches of a neighbouring tree, I climbed to the top with great agility. It was a stately sir, such as the sleep of Homer is said to have ascended in mount Ida, "Vastly tall, and shooting through the air, reached the very sky." Stationed thus for speculation, by the blaze of a lighted flambeau, and the help of the spectacles, whose faithful representation I had already experienced, I pointed my eyes into all the private recesses on the earth, full of the hopes of discovering the virgin simplicity. My conductress, who had followed me up the tree, asked what I was so intent upon: I told her; "Pish! (cried she) simplicity is gone back to heaven; she has ceased to exist on earth for some centuries past: but she did not make her exit, till the human race put a fool's coat on</p>
            <pb n="139" xml:id="pb-139" facs="#i145"/>
            <p>her, and made a jest of her in all places."</p> <p>Whilst I was musing on the information my conductress was pleased to give me, a voice was heard calling us down from the top of the tree. It seems, as I learned when we rejoined the company, a messenger was arrived in post-haste to acquaint madam Moon, that a certain gentleman, who had some affairs of the greatest importance to communicate, would soon wait upon her. We brushed up our faces, adjusted our garments, and set things in order for his reception. At last, a comely looking young man in a long trailing gown made his appearance. Between admiration and curiosity, I was whispered by my conductress, that this was the last comet astronomers and other star-gazers made such bungling conjectures about. Then I, who, according to the sentiments of the Stoics, remembered that they were reputed intelligent souls, took the liberty of addressing him in these words.</p> <p>"May the heavens bless you, my lord Hairy-Pate! Prithee tell me, whence come</p>
            <pb n="140" xml:id="pb-140" facs="#i146"/>
            <p>you, and where are you going> Have Sir Isaac Newton and Doctor Halley been right in their calculations about you? What is Monsieur Descartes now a doing, who would have us believe that the whole heaven was composed of round stones, and subtil matter, and that your species was concreted out of a coalition of planets? Are all things now safe? When do you intend to appear again? The whole world when you did, were fond of fastening their eyes on you, tho' what you are mostly admired for is not new, and many on the earth as well as your lordship, drag a tail after them. Which of them resembles you most is not so easy to determine: for all, who with vast anxiety of mind, and labour of body, accumulate the wealth they keep under lock and key; and all, who for some iniquitous place under any iniquitous government, can fawn upon, and stoop, and basely cringe; and all, who pay their adorations to some old idol for him, or her estate or money, have tails as compleat as your lordship. Had only one miser among</p>

            <p>us, or a corruptor devoid of all shame, or the spoiler of his neighbour's bed, or senseless rake, made their appearance once in ten years, all would run to the sight, as to the shew of a man jumping into a quart-bottle: now a satiety of the error and madness cuts short the absurdity, and our admiration."</p> <p>His lordship made no direct reply to my comment, but digressing to other things, said, with a countenance rather austere than placid. "Remember friend, that many of your countrymen so live their lives, that nothing in a great measure seems wanting to compleat their happiness but probity. Many of them never marry, but keep mistresses discretionally. If you observe how several of them spend their time, you will find that the day insensibly glides away between sleep, sauntering visits, the pleasures of the table and gaming, either of which last amusements they usually protract till late at night, and sometimes till the light of the next day bids them retire with shame. With regard to religion,</p>
            <pb n="142" xml:id="pb-142" facs="#i148"/>
            <p>tho' the least of their concern, some of them live full of faith; but it is a faith, seldom or ever productive of what can be properly called a good work. Certainly, that religion must be sweet and popular to every man, which he relishes most: no matter what cook invented or prepared the sauce, - it will go down: - but if a weak appetite requires something of the stimulus of the haut-goÃ»t, he may add, till he thinks it quite palatable, some few hundred drams of licentiousness, which will totally eradicate all remorse of conscience, and give him a genuine idea of the most fashionable system in religion. Their taste for learning is much of a piece with their religion; for you may swear that they strive in this respect to appear what they are not, that is, critics, the only character now a man should aim at, if he is willing to gain the applause due to the accuracy of a sound judgment. Scarce one in ten thousand would divest himself of his darling self-love, to confess ingenuously that he is no connoisseur in the matter; and hence it is that</p>
            <pb n="143" xml:id="pb-143" facs="#i149"/>
            <p>most of your learned clubs and societies pride themselves in the presidentship of some baker, taylor, cobler, or stage-buffoon, who trouble themselves but little about understanding the real merit of any learned production, provided others seem satisfied with their decisive pretensions, or that they are allowed to behave with sceptical arrogance, and call in question the most sacred truths."</p> <p>After this grave discourse, his lordship wrinkled his nose and forehead, and gave a tripple shrug of his shoulders as a signal either of self-approbation, or that he had a mind to be more loquacious. It was the latter I found he aimed at; for turning again to me: "This year, (said he, with great earnestness in his looks,) all madmen will run mad, among whom, in my opinion, jesters of all denominations are the greatest." - How so? (said I, interrupting him,) jesters are rather knaves than mad-men or fools." - "True, (answered he) one should think so; because they do a deal of harm by malice propense, in their perfect</p>
            <pb n="144" xml:id="pb-144" facs="#i150"/>
            <p>senses, with all their wits about them, and quite alive, knowing thoroughly, and plainly seeing: but they are not therefore the less mad. - They do not act according to reason; and whenever it so happens, they are mad to all intents and purposes." - "Your aim (said I,) is, I apprehend, to establish the paradox, 'that it is madness to trespass against the decorum of pure and strict morality.' - But without such refined notions, I would be glad to know your sentiments upon jesting; it is the very thing I want to have cleared up."</p> <p>Here his lordship paused, or studied, or meditated with shut eyes and a down bent head. A profound silence reigned, and every one of the company stood motionless like statues, 'till they heard him say, "The very thing you want to have cleared up." - - - Aye, here it is. - - - Jesting is two-fold; some jest upon others, and some jest upon themselves. The jesters upon others perform their part in word or deed; the jesters upon themselves prejudice their own welfare by their incongruities in life. You</p>
            <pb n="145" xml:id="pb-145" facs="#i151"/>
            <p>will easily perceive the distinguishing marks of each character in what I shall instance in."</p> <p>"In the act of jesting upon others, there is a difference between circumventing them in business, and circumventing them in discourse. The jester circumvents the jestee in discourse, when he means one thing and says another; when he palliates huge lies with a specious plausibility; or, when by Socratic inductions, of which the credibility cannot be evaded, he forces him in the winding up, to acknowledge as honest and well meaning truth, a long chain of monstrous absurdities. This petulant, tho' seemingly undesigning humour of the jester, is taken as a signal affront by the jestee, when not once or twice, but may be, a hundred times, he has found himself the dupe of his own credulity, and the object of the jester's derision. he declares open war against him, and if ever he makes peace, he flatters himself it must be on the following conditions."</p>
            <pb n="146" xml:id="pb-146" facs="#i152"/>
            <p>'That no jester shall pretend to be superior in sense to another person.'</p> <p>'That every jester in discourse, and treating with another upon any subject whatsoever, shall declare nothing but the naked truth.'</p> <p>'That every jester shall avoid all equivocation and mental reservation, and that he shall not pretend he thought it was so, or that this or that person averred it as matter of fact.'</p> <p>'That every jester shall totally relinquish all enigmatical kinds of expressions; that his ideas shall be transmitted to the ears of his auditors in the vehicle of common terms, agreed upon and allowed by all to signify such and such things, and that he shall upon no pretext whatever, call a collected body of wise senators a junto of sycophants. - A privy council, a set of working tools. - - - A statesman, a grinder down of the stings of conscience. - A bench of judges, a wench's under petticoat. - A court of chancery, an irremeable labyrinth. - A lawyer, an imp</p>

            <pb n="148" xml:id="pb-148" facs="#i154"/>
            <p>what was the best method to prevent their ill designs? - "They are easily known by their works, (answered he,) but to prevent their machinations taking effect before you know them, will be a very arduous task, unless you have confirmed yourself in a fixed resolution of dealing with all the world as rogues: however, a variety of cases will make that precaution, unnecessary, selfish, or absurd." - His lordship being again asked, by what means a person in England may become suddenly rich? "By Bankruptcy; (said he.) - What is the most difficult thing in these times? Not to write a satyr. - What is the most foolish? To provoke those that can. - - What is the cheapest commodity now at market? Blind nuts and wise men; neither are ever made lords of the Tr-s-ry. - Who are the most miserable? The most honest; for conscience always forces them out of the world's byass: they can never play the hypocrite themselves, neither do they pry into what hypocrites have on the carpet. - Why is G-t Br-n the dupe</p>
            <pb n="149" xml:id="pb-149" facs="#i155"/>
            <p>of all the nations in Europe? Because she is too easily prevailed upon by them to part with her money. - Why are ministers of state usually hated? Because they lay it down as a maxim to betray always their trust. - Why are B-ps generally afflicted with the gout? Because they live not now as in the primitive ages of the church, upon the charities of the faithful. - How is it that P-rs-ns are such passionate in-amoratoes of their pipes and bottles? They would fain pass from a cold, or lukewarm state to all the intenseness of fervent devotion. - What should folks be very cautious about in London? Taylors bills; for tho' they write and spell ill, they have acquired the art of making good and legible figures. - What is the greatest scandal to the B-sh nation? The multiplicity of its perplexed laws. - What may be the result of this multiplicity of perplexed laws? Long, tedious and intricate forms of litigation, whereby the lives and wealth of the parties are frequently quite exhausted amidst vain hopes of a final decision. - </p>

            <p>Who are the propagators and supporters of this grievance so destructive in its consequences of private property? A very numerous body of bar-orators and their understrappers, who now have got more than half of the estates of the Br-sh realms into their hands. They never think of imitating a Demosthenes, or a Cicero, who to relieve the distressed, vigorously exerted all the powers of a happy eloquence; on the contrary, these gentlemen of nice honour, strict integrity, and fair characters, prove themselves very industrious in sucking dry the sap of orphans, and marrow of widows; in setting folks together by the ears, to pick their pockets whilst they can foment enmity between them; and leaving them beggars when they make them friends. - Cannot the evil be redressed? It is in the power of the legislature to do it, and a glorious act it would be! It is not so difficult a matter to distinguish between right and wrong; to cut short all unnecessary proceedings; to have justice administered in much less time, and at an easier</p>

It is the idlest thing in nature to say that there is no law to evince the guilt of such a prevaricator. Is not there a law written in every one's heart to condemn him? And is not that law sufficient?"</p> <p>His lordship, the Comet, at the close of these words, was pleased to let us know that he did not chuse to be asked any more questions; so having strutted two or three turns about the room in great state, as a memorandum of his friendship, he took his leave of us with an embrace. Not long after his departure, I espied a place of retirement to the left, and in a walled hard by, a very narrow cleft. My conductress persuaded me to apply my ear to it: For; (said she,) many sinister arts are there practised. By listening attentively, you will know what all rivals think of you, and what judgment all busy-bodies, employed in idleness, out of breath in trifling, running about in a hurry, doing many things</p>
            <pb n="152" xml:id="pb-152" facs="#i158"/>
            <p>and doing nothing, form of the serious world."</p> <p>At first, I heard dissonant and confused clamours; soon after distinct judgments and voices. But coveting to see, if possible, as well as hear, I had again recourse to my spectacles. I saw indeed and was glad; yet what I first saw was dismal: it was a scene of the doings of death. Nothing, I found, was so common; and when any person was necessitated to comply with this law of nature, a little earth being sprinkled on him, he was consigned over to all the sweetness of a pleasing oblivion, especially by him whom he had helped to the whole or part of his inheritance. Tears too, for fashion and example sake, were shed; but were dried up ungratefully in some, before even the funeral ceremony was over. I also remarked, that all obeyed not death's summons with the same turn of mind. Some, who flattered themselves to live for ever, and who were busied in projecting immensities, were extinguished by a fever,</p>
            <pb n="153" xml:id="pb-153" facs="#i159"/>
            <p>or some fortuitous blow of fatality, and this in earnest, without any hopes of ever returning. I likewise saw some misers, who when they had always possessed their own as another's, transmitted it again to an heir as another's, well covered and packed up, before they ever thought of using it. There were some, who without any positive orders from their creditors, departed, not from this life, but for some time from business, yet upon stipulated conditions of returning a little after more rich: and this is the kind of trade that now yields amongst us the greatest profits.</p> <p>Whilst with inquisitive eyes I examined into the motions of these honest debtors, I overheard some others condemn my itch for preaching in so out-of-the-way a manner. ' 'Tis monstrous', said one. 'D-mn his liberties', said another. Some wondered why I lay idle so long. ' Aye, he has been hatching mischief,' said another. Some allowed me a little merit; others not one grain. Some were surprized that</p>
            <pb n="154" xml:id="pb-154" facs="#i160"/>
            <p>I never made my court to a great lord, or great lady. 'Ten to one (added they) but he or she would be glad to father or mother what he migth write: or, if this would not do, could not he comment something in favour of some suspected statesman? It is well known what money went out of the Exchequer in Sir R-'s time to pay authors.' "Pshaw! you are quite wrong, (replied others:) the scale is turned; all our statesmen are now very circumspect and honest; they want no hired writers to skreen their designs with fair outsides; this would be a ready way to have their schemes canvassed: but here, if they perceive that an author has smelt out their conduct, they throw him a soporiferous morsel, as AEneas, if we believe Virgil, did to Cerberus, to keep him from barking. Hence may be traced the grand arcanum of government, which not only show'rs down blessings on indigent scribblers, but also displays corruscant sun-beams on the hearts of courtiers, and members of p-, who sensible</p>

            <p>of the auspicious influence, subscribe without the least reluctant emotion, to all conditions, interesting, as they must presume, their country's welfare."</p> <p>I cannot forget that I heard many of this malevolent crew give out that I was dead. This information they could have from no other than Tristram Shandy, who in order to disguise the pyracy of my Sermons, or that I bequeathed them to him on my death-bed, made two black leaves in his book, as a sepulchral monument of my demise, with the inscription of 'ALAS POOR YORRICK!' - But to convince them of their error, I can tell them with a safe conscience, that I never remembered to have expired, or that the coroner's inquest ever sat upon me, or that I was ever honoured with a funeral procession. Such things are not transacted without many witnesses, and I myself thought it not so advisable to change rashly my colony. I say again, to convince them of their error, that a dead dog cannot bite, which, I am confident, may be attested</p>

            <p>by an old wife in my neighbourhood, who told her gossips so, as others told her, and they may tell others, as she told them.</p> <p>I could hear also a lubberly, unweildy, overgrown-fat-gutted what-d'y-call-him, a hog of the never satisfied herd, whose life spent in acts of injustice, heaping place upon place, sleep, and luxurious tables, never permitted him to think of the author of life, and for what ends it was designed - I could hear, I say, this public spirited gentleman express himself with admiration, why I did not strip off my gown, and apply for a place under the government which might be more lucrative than a bishoprick. 'Lard, (added he,) what a good thing it is to have a friend at court!' - And so soon as these words were out, be began to yawn and pandiculate. - Not far from him I descried three of your town smatterers in poetry, who were devoured with melancholy because they heard some wits at George's say, I had keen talents at satyr.</p>

            <p>Though much in haste, I left for the fat Mynheer and the poets a medicinal prescription in the wall: for the latter, that every day they should be pleased to apply a collyrium of onion juice to their eyes, and I warrant them they would not want a copious flow of tears; for the love of Helicon must dictate to them that,</p> <p>Sorrow confin'd will break the heart,</p> <p>But shed in tears must ease the smart.</p> <p>For the former, that when he had well purged his abdomen by repeated doses of coloquintida, and cleared his head by hellebore, he would devote himself to the reading of the four evangelists. There, he would learn many things he was before entirely ignorant of, particularly, that the end of life is spirit and truth, and not a time-server's filthy lucre, and that the instrument of this spirit and truth, is the soul, the much better part of man, which the generality now place, not in the brain, but in the belly, where</p>

            <p>experiments of universal attraction are illustrated by incontestable demonstration. Though some should place their summum bonum <note>Latin</note>in a civil, others in a military occupation, and others in a pot of beer, tobacco, and a warm fire; there is no reason, I see, why they should therefore censure those who place it in the culture of their minds, or why they themselves ought not to allot some of their mispent hours for resolutions more worthy of the human than brute creation.</p> <p>Here finding myself grow too serious, to remedy it, I addressed my amiable protectress in these unknown regions, that, as now an opportunity served, she would transform by the irresistible force of her incantations, the poets into reviewers, and the fat gentleman into a sow. Surprized at what I proposed, she protested that she never heard that any one had migrated twice into the same animal. 'I will prove it, added she, by Ovid's Metamorphosis. There you read how Hecuba was turned into a bitch, but no where, a</p>
            <pb n="159" xml:id="pb-159" facs="#i165"/>

However, to save my honour and reputation, she ordered a herald at arms to promulgate at Charing-Cross, and the Royal Exchange, that</p> <p>"All manner of persons are to take notice, lest in any time hence they pretend ignorance, that I have totally laid aside all trifling, my entire occupation being to meditate whole days on sermons of this sort, and that nothing now is wanting but proper texts. That all must be cautious how they provoke an innocent, who of himself will hurt none, as to this day of himself he has hurted none. That if any one intends to run counter to this mandate, from this time forth, let him with all succeeding ages be accounted in-famous. As to the libels by little and obscure authors, levelled with all their mighty stock of virulence against the constitution, the prince, the minister, the peers, and all honest men, they are best left to proscribe of themselves the merit they pretend to.

And must not the country be irritated against those who instead of stopping the depredations of locusts, invite and push them forward like batterings rams to commit more enormous ravages? Their intellects seem to be a degree more stupid than the intellects of asses, and, for aught I know, their mould more base. But let them be asses, and when they die, may they, according to the truth and institutes of the Pythagoric law, for a thousand years among Laplanders, pass from asses into asses."</p> <p>This proclamation was scarce finished, when, as sleep is not only a wonderful, but even sudden mimic of all things, I heard an ass by way of applause to bray lustily just at my elbow. Turning about, I laid hold of him, and saying I would try what mettle he was made of, I forthwith mounted, and jockey like, made good use of whip and spur. But he, contrary to his family-nature, kicked up</p>
            <pb n="161" xml:id="pb-161" facs="#i167"/>
            <p>his heels and tossed me off. In this dismal plight, bereaved almost of my senses, by the fall, I crawled along with much ado to my mistress, who received me with sweet speeches and fond embraces, and after as many soft whispers, gave me a dose of invigorating Drops. I swallowed it instantly according to her directions, and in a moment as not in the least hurt, or troubled in mind or body, I felt the activity of pleasures exquisite permeating all my senses. Swelling tides of dissatisfaction departed from my breast, and my eyes which stood clouded with bursting tears, began to shoot forth glances of charming serenity. So it is in the purple morn, when light expels the dreary phantasms of darkness: enlivening joys and gladning companions stand round. So it is, when the bowl replete with nectarous juices, forces smiles from the Doctor, and all his beadles, overseers and church-wardens. The jovial blades in brimmers quaffing prosperity to * * * * and church, strip themselves stark naked of all their</p>

            <p>stiff, sullen, and morose airs. Merriment expands her wings on their florid cheeks; new hopes winging a precipitate flight from the etherial mansions pervade their triumphant souls, and the corroding cares of poor-rates and parish-fees, flutter in order from their stomachs.</p> <p>These transports of joy, which, no doubt, were excessive, having raised a strange commotion in my animal spirits, sleep left me; much, I am certain, contrary to my inclination, because I had neither thanked her, whose extreme kindness guided my wandering steps in these unknown regions, nor made a few enquiries, I thought to do, of madam Moon, who, I was persuaded, would not hesitate to resolve all my doubts. However, I had seen and heard enough to convince me, that the fashion of this world passeth away in jests. And</p> <p>Such throughout the world is the power of error embarassing us in its mazes.

The finest things deceive our sentiments of them; even the golden lustre of pure day cannot guard us against the influence of sleep, jesting, and fancy.

XV.</p> <p>THE parson was in the middle of his last sentence, gracing it with a becoming elocution, when the rustling and rolling of a coach, succeeded by raps of authority at the door, were heard. my father ran down stairs with the servants to see who it was. The rest of the company alarmed by the Squire's arch surmise, concluded that it was Dr. Rantum, who, to be revenged of the affront he had received,</p>
            <pb n="164" xml:id="pb-164" facs="#i170"/>
            <p>came back to beset the house with a posse of catchpoles. The woman were sorely afraid; but upon over-hearing my father on the stairs saying to the person he was shewing the way to, "Sir, you do me infinite honour. - It is a favour I never expected. - It is more than I or any of my family deserve" . . . - their consternation was much abated, and they prepared in a hurry to receive the visitant with composed countenances. </p> <p>This person was a Minister of state, and though he was known by character to all the company, who frequently talked themselves, or heard talk of the measures of his administration, he was personally known to none but the parson, whom singling out from the rest, he accosted, when he was seated and had looked about him, with the words: "So, parson * * * *, it is you, I see. - I find you make good your quarters every where." - True, said the parson, your honour knows I belong to one of the never failing trades. - A parson and midwife are seldom out of</p>
            <pb n="165" xml:id="pb-165" facs="#i171"/>
            <p>their way." - "But, good Sir, (said my father,) the parson is no intruder; he came here on a fair invitation, and has just favoured us with a Sermon upon jesting. If you had heard it, you would say with Horace, est quod tollere velles, <note>Latin</note> there were some things you could like, though I can't say much in commendation of the oeconomy of the discourse, being rather whimsical, or overstrained by assuming the air of a romance. But of this the parson himself apprized us in his preliminaries. he is sensible of his irregularities, and as he is not himself in the humour to rectify them, the force of objections against his manner may be said to be quite disarmed." - "Your observation is good, Mr. Montfichet, (said the minister,) the parson seems fond of a few caprichios, all innocent in the main, and far from having a tendency to disturb the public tranquillity. - Let me see . . . You told me below stairs I had no occasion to make exceptions against any of your company; they were all honest, well-meaning</p>
            <pb n="166" xml:id="pb-166" facs="#i172"/>
            <p>men, you said; - but, pray, which of them is your brother Mr. Richard Montfichet? - Fame is very munificent of her encomiums on him. - I assure you, for some time past, I have had a mighty desire to be favoured with the acquaintance of so eminent a self-taught philosopher."</p> <p>Hereupon, my father introduced my uncle Dick to the minister. They first with right and left cheeks kissed alternately in the French mode, and afterwards shook hands in the English fashion. Neither were deficient in compliments, that is, in words fit for compliments; but the minister had the advantage of a courtly air to set his off: nothing but pure unaffected nature spoke in my uncle Dick. - "Oddfucks! we forgot brother (cried my uncle Dick, turning from the minister to my father) to pay our respects to his honour, rather first in an act of hospitality than fair words. - If you have not dined, Sir, (turning to the minister) - I suppose you have not; it is not yet the quality hour, - and if you can make a</p>
            <pb n="167" xml:id="pb-167" facs="#i173"/>
            <p>dinner off of the carcass of a goose, or a neck of mutton and turneps, we have both in the house, - you will be exceeding welcome. - I will dress either for you in three minutes, if the sun serves, with my speculum ustorium. <note>Latin</note> - I wish you had been here time enough to partake of the repast we made. - We had a curious Portcus Trojanus, and the over-grown liver of a goose, and it is the carcass of this goose I will dress for you, if you have a mind to it"</p> <p>The minister interrupted my uncle Dick several times, thanking and telling him that he had dined. He asked him some questions about the nature of his speculum ustorium, Porcus Trojanus, and over-grown goose's liver, all which my uncle Dick resolved him in to his satisfaction. At last the minister opened his mind to him, that he came on purpose to have his opinion concerning some better method than the customary of facilitating and carrying on p-t elections without bribery and corruption. The bane of</p>
            <pb n="168" xml:id="pb-168" facs="#i174"/>
            <p>the nation, he said was nothing else, as he could find, but corruption; it had already sapped the foundations of the constitution, and would infallibly, unless timely prevented, lay it in ruins when people were least aware of the danger.</p> <p>My uncle Dick replied, that he would with pleasure give him his opinion, but that he believed the reformation of an evil so firmly rooted, would be attended with insurmountable difficulties; that there were reasons, and very cogent ones, to make corruption a condition, without which government under certain circumstances could not long subsist; however, that it could not be amiss to talk the matter over, and see what speculation might offer, though it should be morally impossible to proceed successfully to the practice.</p> <p>"I have already either abolished (said the minister) several abuses in the state, or greatly weakened their force and habit. The time of my administration, you know, has yet been but short; and if prolonged,</p>
            <pb n="169" xml:id="pb-169" facs="#i175"/>
            <p>which I hope it will for the service of my country, shall it not be incumbent on me to slay by vigorous attacks the monster of corruption? At least the attempt will be noble, and if I fall in it, I shall fall nobly. Come, let us enter upon this conference. I . . ." - Here, my father with his good leave, made a motion to suspend the conference, till he had the opinion of his physicians upon the method of begetting male children, after which he would be fully disengaged himself from all concern to take a part in projecting remedies against the mischiefs of state-corruption. He added, that he had signified to his honour as much when he received him at the door, and informed him of the intent of the present solemnity in his house. - My uncle Dick alledged several reasons, that it would be best to postpone the doctor's consultation; particularly, that the debates and long hearing it must require, might be disagreeable to his honour, who was accustomed to a dispatch of business without preamble</p>
            <pb n="170" xml:id="pb-170" facs="#i176"/>
            <p>and circumlocution. - The advice seemed rational to my father; besides, the minister having intimated that he had some matters of importance to be forwarded to foreign parts, my father asked pardon for proposing any thing that should detain him beyond his just time. - The minister thanked him for his complaisance; adding, that he would take upon him to settle the preliminaries of the conference with a Discourse on Government and the Constitution, which he did, as may be seen in the next chapter.</p> <p>CHAP. XVI.</p> <p>"TACITUS, in the fourth book of his annals, (said the minister, the whole company appearing very attentive to his words;) has this memorable passage: 'All nations and cities are governed by the people, or by the chief men of the state, or by one person. A form of administration modelled and constituted</p>
            <pb n="171" xml:id="pb-171" facs="#i177"/>
            <p>from a coalition of these three, is highly commendable, tho' probably it can have no real existence, or if it should exist, it cannot be lasting? The historian was led, no doubt, into this reflection, from considering the perversity which but too often is so inherent to mankind, and so imperceptibly mingles with their very essence, that tho' a mind, possessed with the ardours of planning a system, in all respects truly grand, noble, and deserving of the observance of rational beings, yet must find herself fallen short of her aim, when the same is intended to be reduced to practice. Then it is, that the system can only be denominated an exquisitely delineated pourtrait, resembling something existing in the imagination, but by intervening accidents not admitting the native lights and colours of reality. Plato's Common-wealth has had its admirers, and the laws of Lycurgus, Solon, and others, their observers: but the former afforded only an ideal satisfaction, and if it was possible to conform to the latter, the nature of man impatient</p>
            <pb n="172" xml:id="pb-172" facs="#i178"/>
            <p>of restraint, is a sufficient evidence that the institution could be but temporary; because *, tho' towers of policy should be raised to the very clouds, yet sudden gusts of unexpected accidents might tumble them into ruins, to the confusion of their contrivers and builders: and this is a reason, why politics will never arrive at perfection upon account of the changes in commonwealths, which is also justified by the laws of God, that have varied according to the different state of men, times, and circumstances.</p> <p>An invincible desire of happiness being implanted in the heart of man by the great Author of nature, it was necessary to the perfection of the works of the creation, that this divine energy should obtain the end of its operations. Hence therefore is derived, as from a great and fruitful source, the impulsive cause of forming and establishing states and cities: for, as man loves himself and his own utility; that is, as self-preservation influences the</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Vid. Fitz-Herbert's Pol. and Relig.</p>

            <p>greater part of his actions, or rather, is the main spring by which he is prompted to act, he will spontaneously engage in civil society, and for this purpose will relinquish his natural liberty, and subject himself to the direction of others. Why man should make this kind of sacrifice of himself might seem strange, unless we consider that he is influenced by the pleasing prospect of a greater addition to his happiness in consequence of the security civil society gives him a certain warrant of. He is sensible that no animal is more cruel, more untractable, and more prone to a multiplicity of vices, destructive of the peace of society, than those of his own species are. Besides natural desires, which are common to them with brute-beasts, they are agitated by several criminal passions, brutes are ignorant of. Among others, an insatiable thirst after superfluities, and ambition the worst of evils; a lively remembrance of injuries, and a long cherished ardour of revenge; an infinite dissimilarity of inclinations and appetites,</p>
            <pb n="174" xml:id="pb-174" facs="#i180"/>
            <p>and frequently a very disagreeable obstinate selfishness: so that man may be properly said to rage with such fury against his own kind, that the greatest part of the calamities incident to the condition of human life, proceed solely from himself.</p> <p>The genuine therefore and principal cause of setting aside natural liberty to have recourse to civil society, was to procure a safeguard against the misfortunes that threaten man from man. This safe-guard was nothing else than the enforcing of the observance of certain wholsome laws, of which the infraction, according to the stipulated consent of the society, was to be attended with punishments adequate to the deserts of the delinquent; and the execution of these laws was committed to the authority of one person who was styled king; or, to that of a few, who assumed the title of nobles; or, to that of many, who were called the people; whence the distinctions of monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical governments.</p> <p>It is foreign to my purpose to enter</p>
            <pb n="175" xml:id="pb-175" facs="#i181"/>
            <p>here into a disceptation concerning that sort of government of these three, which may be deemed the most productive of good for civil society. All I shall say is, that the monarchical in the administration of a wicked man degenerates into despotism, tyranny and oppression; that the aristocratical is nearly allied to regal arbitrary sway; and that the democratical, tho' tending to the preservation of liberty, has often experienced a miserable catastrophe from the dismal effects of anarchy and confusion.</p> <p>Tacitus has recorded of the emperor Trajan, that he was the first that united in his government, princely power and liberty, things formerly unsociable, and seemingly incompatible. Agreeably to this notion, and to what I have already cited int he beginning from the same Author, the British nation, to its great glory be it spoken, has wisely adopted a system of government, which, whilst maintained pure and uncorrupt, on one side, will not dread the ills of arbitrary proceedings,</p>
            <pb n="176" xml:id="pb-176" facs="#i182"/>
            <p>nor on the other, the furious rage of an inconsiderate populace. Holding a just medium between both, the force of its authoritative powers shews that it is founded on the mutual consent of the subject and rulers; because, all being born to liberty, they cannot reasonably be subjected to others, unless by consent; which consent Plato calls harmony and numbers. For, as harmony is the result of different voices singing in tune, and as a sum, or total is made up of divers numbers; so this consent of different men, all tending to compass the same salutary ends, must be consistent with harmonical proportion: and, it will be so, 'if first, the * magistrate has a due regard to the public utility:' for all love, and willingly adhere to that, from whence they see an advantage derived to them; and hence it is, that some philosophers have called a well-regulated commonwealth both concord and discord. concord, when the magistrate and people conspire to promote the public utility. Discord,</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Vid. Polit. Instit. Boxhornii.</p>
            <pb n="177" xml:id="pb-177" facs="#i183"/>
            <p>when the diversity of state between the magistrate and subject falls under consideration. This concord and discord nature exactly imitates. Nothing is so contrary as the elements to themselves; notwithstanding, out of them the harmonical universe is composed: and, as upon the dissolution of these elements, it is not possible that the species of bodies can subsist, or that the constituent parts of the universe can retain their former cohesion, so neither can the common-wealth remain intire when this discordant concord is torn asunder.</p> <p>The second manner of obtaining this consent is, 'if the governing power be under the influence of reason.' For, it is natural to think, that he who covets to have the will of others subject to him, should first subject his won will to the dictates of reason. When the people obey the magistrate, who governs according to the prescript of reason, they presume that they obey reason, and by obeying reason they are satisfied that they obey themselves; because they act with reason, or</p>
            <pb n="178" xml:id="pb-178" facs="#i184"/>
            <p>at least flatter themselves that they have attentively listened to its admonitions. It is therefore incumbent on the magistrate, in order to have this consent and compliance, to conform unreservedly his own will and pleasure to the most rational way of proceeding.</p> <p>The third manner of obtaining this consent is, 'if to all the members some part of the administration of the common-wealth be committed.' This seems to be the basis of British government and liberty. No state can complain of being excluded from participating in the management of the public affairs, and from the joint consent of the three states assembled together, called the parliament, are all matters relating tot he good of the community transacted and carried into execution. These three states consist of the king, the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons; which last are the representatives of all the commons in the kingdom, and in them their constituents have placed the highest confidence, by investing them with the</p>
            <pb n="179" xml:id="pb-179" facs="#i185"/>
            <p>power of making laws, and entrusting them with all their liberties and privileges. So that in the whole, the British system of government may not improperly be compared with some grand machine of the ballance-kind; the king and commons tending to counterpoize each other, and the lords endeavouring to maintain in both a just equilibrium.</p> <p>It may appear from this imperfect sketch of British government, in what a signal manner providence has blessed us above other nations, by rooting so firmly in our hearts the love of order and liberty. The subjects of other kingdoms may groan under the menacing frowns of arbitrary capriciousness; but we, so long as we preserve unaltered our glorious constitution, may justly pride ourselves in the valuable possessions of internal peace and opulence. It will be our own fault, if we forfeit, or lose the depositum of so great a treasure. Should not we then use the utmost vigilance to guard it, and should not we even at the hazard of our lives</p>
            <pb n="180" xml:id="pb-180" facs="#i186"/>

An inveterate kind of depravity so engrosses the affections of the greater part, that they never allot themselves time to deliberate upon the intention of their actions. What is most prevalent with them, in the corrupt example of others, persons perhaps in power, and highly esteemed: hence, the darling vice grows into habit, and they are easily, or without much reluctance on their side, swept down the torrent. The disorder therefore appearing remediless, it would be greatly conducive to the upright patriot's repose to seclude himself from all commerce with ill-designing men, to set aside all concern for state</p>
            <pb n="181" xml:id="pb-181" facs="#i187"/>
            <p>affairs, to inculcate no maxims of true policy, to harbour no ill opinion of the infractors of equitable laws, all pretending to be indemnified by authority, or seconded by example; in short, to suffer every individual to indulge his capricious humour, and live according to the dictates of his favourite folly.</p> <p>It may naturally be thought that such sentiments are as a benevolent sarcasm upon mankind; the best method for procuring amendment, being often to laugh persons out of their vices, or ridicule them into virtue. But supposing they aim at matters of fact, as indeed they do, and that perhaps few or none ever intend to reap benefit for the regular conducting of life from any profered instruction; it is, however, presumed that the beauty, the force, and the energy of the British constitution ought never to be absent from the minds of true Britons, much less depart from the affections of their heart: other-wise, they must, from slaves to their own passions, becomes slaves to the passions of</p>

            <p>others; they will forfeit their liberty, and in their turn make trial of the oppression other nations are now fallen under from a like misconduct. Such was the cause of the downfal of the greatest republic in the world, I mean the Roman, which, by suffering itself to be enamoured of the illusions of corruption, fell from the best regulated liberty into the snares of the worst tyranny and oppression.</p> <p>Nothing better can be inculcated to illustrate the respective duty of candidates for seats in parliament, and their electors, than what the laws themselves recommend; and hence also is observable the excellency of the constitution, which, under the direction of providence, extends itself to most cases, and makes all necessary provisions to defeat the malice of corrupt and venal hearts. But it has been found that some of the proposers and makers of those very laws have wantonly abused them; and what is more strange, that the grand corruptors have been reputed men of strict honour and integrity</p>
            <pb n="183" xml:id="pb-183" facs="#i189"/>
            <p>in the opinion of the corrupted, nay, even have proceeded on more noble principles than those who bore against the torrent of corruption.</p> <p>In another point of view, but tending to the same end for completing the fulness of iniquitous practices, what must be thought, when we hear persons by a religious assertion, which we call an oath, renounce the divine mercy, or imprecate to themselves the divine vengeance, unless they declare and hold to the truth; and yet falsify this asseveration by a conduct known afterwards to be quite the reverse? The duty of him that taketh an oath, according to Civilians, 'is to swear with reverence, and to observe religiously what he has sworn:' so that, we all naturally think, that when an omniscient and omnipotent witness and avenger is invoked, the presumption of truth must be excited in us; because none are believed to be so rashly impious, as wantonly to implore the heaviest wrath and indignation of the divine Being: but, alas! some by their</p>

            <p>conduct, seem to have whispered their hearts into a persuasion that there is no avenging Divine Being, or they consider the notion of his existence as very abstract, or that his providence is quite regardless of their particular actions; it is human respect, and the fear of punishment, that influence their duty, whenever they do it; and were it not for this restraint, private utility would always pre-ponderate.</p> <p>If then the depravity of most men be such, that little confidence can be placed in them; if mere prohibitions, if threats of penalties can have no effect upon them; especially when artful evasions and interpretations are made to clear them from the imputation of guilt, it would be best to put it out of their power to do wrong, by removing from them as much as possible the temptation; and this Mr. Richard Montfichet, (added the minister, concluding his discourse,) is what I expect from your political contrivance."</p>
            <pb n="185" xml:id="pb-185" facs="#i191"/>
            <p>CHAP. XVII.</p> <p>MY uncle Dick replied, (the whole company, so interesting and important was the matter, still remaining as mute as fishes;) that he understood well what the minister had in view, and that agreeably to his notions he would beg leave to propose a new regulation for facilitating elections without clamours, trouble and expence; but did not presume there was merit enough in it to recommend it to use; neither did he suppose it would ever be followed. - The minister having encouraged him to proceed, making no doubt but that this regulation would be very good, he submitted it to his consideration much in this order.</p> <p>"Every city, burrough or corporation in the British dominions, that has a right to send a member, or members to parliament, would act in all probability with great prudence, if in case of a general election, or upon a vacancy for a member</p>
            <pb n="186" xml:id="pb-186" facs="#i192"/>
            <p>members, the freemen of each city, burrough or corporation assembled and deliberated in a common council about the nomination of a proper person, or persons to represent them in parliament. This nomination should</p> <p>First, be agreed to, decided and ratified by a majority of voices.</p> <p>Secondly, they should nominate at least double the number required, for a reason that shall appear hereafter.</p> <p>Thirdly, they should nominate, preferably to all others, worthy persons belonging to the same city, burrough, corporation, or district; and in default of such, any person or persons throughout the British dominions, possessed of the necessary qualifications for their representatives in parliament. - These qualifications I would not have understood to be such or such an estate without incumbrances, but real merit grounded on an unblemished character and a thorough knowledge of the laws, usages, immunities, privileges and true interests of the state: otherwise, the</p>
            <pb n="187" xml:id="pb-187" facs="#i193"/>
            <p>estate of such a just value and not the man, would be the member of parliament. The absurdity is glaring, unless it be thought that a person possessed of such an estate is incapable of being corrupted, and for no other reason than that of its being supposed he does not want to be corrupted, having enough to live upon.</p> <p>Fourthly, having agreed upon every particular regarding the nomination, they should thus proceed to the election. - Let there be two wheels contrived after the manner of those used for the drawing of lotteries. into one wheel let the names of the electors be put, each name being written upon a separate billet or ticket. Into the other wheel, let the names of the nominated candidates be put: but the number of their names must be double the number of the electors; that is, supposing there are a hundred electors and four nominated candidates, two of which are to be declared elected: each of these candidates is to have his name written on fifty tickets, and four times fifty will be the</p>
            <pb n="188" xml:id="pb-188" facs="#i194"/>
            <p>double of one hundred. - Upon drawing an elector's name, and afterwards the name of a candidate, a public crier, or officer may proclaim with a loud voice, that such an elector has voted for such a candidate. This vote must be faithfully registred by clerks appointed for that purpose. The drawing is to be continued till every elector's name is drawn; and then, as the remaining names of the candidates in their wheel, are of no account, the clerks may sum up for what candidate, or candidates, the majority of the electors names have been drawn, upon which they may be declared duly elected. I mentioned that there should at least be double the number required, nominated; as otherwise the election could not be said to be decided by lot.</p> <p>There cannot be a fairer way than this, for the electing of members for parliament, or for any other office. Merit is not left to chance, but only the decision of the greater merit, and chance in this respect may well be deemed Divine Providence,</p>
            <pb n="189" xml:id="pb-189" facs="#i195"/>
            <p>the very manner of proceeding being much of the same nature with what had been practised by the Apostles to supply the place of the prevaricator Judas Iscariot. Besides, there is scarce an open left for bribery, little or no expence is required, and all tumult and faction are quite disarmed and extinguished."</p> <p>"I like your scheme well, (said the minister;) but methinks you have not made sufficient provision in it, to guard against the main point, corruption; and this you hint yourself, 'that there is scarce an open left for bribery.' - In my opinion, the open is considerable: for the electors may be bribed to nominate such and such persons preferably to others; and, as all the chances are equally good, one need not regret hazarding his money and gifts to make sure of his chance. In the ordinary method of carrying on elections, candidates equally potent in making interest for being elected, stand upon a similar footing of chance. It will little signify then, which way they are elected, whether by open votes, or by lot.</p>
            <pb n="190" xml:id="pb-190" facs="#i196"/>
            <p>However, I must confess, that your scheme would be the more eligible in one sense, and that is, when a candidate's purse is so long in extending itself to the exigencies of the electors, that before its resources are exhausted, it allays the fumes of passion and prejudice, it renders by its sweetly impelling force the opposite party-spirit more tractable, it hastens by large strides to bear down upon the affections of hearts, and at last, by a more than quantum sufficit <note>Latin</note> reduction of them, inspires its principal dispensing bearer, now sure of hitting his mark, with the jocund mirth of proud leers and contemptuous sneers at the disappointment of those antagonists, who fed themselves with the delusion of deciding the contest by honour, integrity, and love for the country: specious names, but like sepulchral monuments, bespeaking only the lustre of extinct virtues!"</p> <p>"Your observations are excellent, Sir, (replied my uncle Dick,) and I readily allow with you, that my election-plan, such as I proposed it, will not intirely defeat</p>
            <pb n="191" xml:id="pb-191" facs="#i197"/>
            <p>the artifice of men when once intent upon the means of corrupting and being corrupted. But as in many cases provisions are not deemed firm enough to obtain their end without collateral securities, it will be worth our while to see whether it be practicable to put the electors out of the biass of honesty, if due care be taken to circumscribe them in it by the following restrictions and penalties."</p> <p>First, that there shall be no open and declared nomination of candidates by votes; that is, every elector shall drop into an urn or box a billet with his own name written on it and the name of the person he approves of. This is to be done by the electors immediately after they have agreed upon the necessary number of properly qualified candidates. - It will not be amiss to have the billet box so constructed, that it cannot be opened without breaking it; because if it had lock or key, or could be opened at discretion by the keeper of it, all the proposed good from secrecy would be made void.</p>
            <pb n="192" xml:id="pb-192" facs="#i198"/>
            <p>Secondly, as a greater sanction to this manner of proceeding, each elector is to make oath that his conscience is thoroughly satisfied with the person he has so nominated; that he has not been tampered with by him previously to the nomination; and that he will keep as an inviolable secret till the election is fully decided, the name of him he has made choice of himself on his billet, as well as the names of the rest agreed upon by unanimous consent; any of which particulars, if he is found to prevaricate in, he is willing to subject himself to such penalties as the laws please to inflict.</p> <p>Thirdly, the billet-box is not to be broke open till the very day of the election by the method I have already set forth. Then, if any of those put in nomination are to be excluded the chance of the wheel, it will be readily known and determined by the less number of electors in their favour.</p> <p>The affair of elections thus circumstanced, it will be almost morally impossible</p>
            <pb n="193" xml:id="pb-193" facs="#i199"/>
            <p>for corruption to facilitate to itself the least access for the playing off of its wiles. A person may have strong hopes, nay, even may be certain of being nominated with him. He does not know what number of electors have billeted for him. He may be set aside from the chance of the wheel. That chance also may turn out unsuccessful. How shall he, therefore, amidst so many perplexing doubts presume that it is his interest to corrupt? Besides, pursuant to the rigour of the regulation, he is supposed to be intirely ignorant of being nominated, in virtue of the oath the electors have bound themselves by, not to divulge the least tittle of what has passed amongst them."</p> <p>My uncle Dick having added, that extempore thought could suggest to him nothing better than what he had just proposed upon the subject, but that if the minister was pleased to honour him with his commands, he would perhaps by long and profound meditation perfect something</p>
            <pb n="194" xml:id="pb-194" facs="#i200"/>
            <p>of a less troublesome, more uniform, and more effectual system; the minister thanked, and with a smile of satisfaction assured him, that his regulation was extremely well concerted, easy in practice, and . . . . - 'Hold, Sir, hold; (said my uncle Dick, interrupting the minister, and pointing the fore-finger of his right hand at him, and clapping that of his left on his own nose;) another thought has just come into my head, which I verily believe will do the business. - Let all electors, and the troubles incident to them, be put out of the question; and let all persons throughout Great Britain, properly qualified by their importance in probity, science and wealth, be made candidates for representatives of the people in parliament. This can be effected by way of lottery. If the names of all the candidates are put into one wheel, and an equal number of blanks and prizes into the other, the name that draws a prize will intitle the bearer of it to a seat in parliament. The prizes need not exceed the number of</p>
            <pb n="195" xml:id="pb-195" facs="#i201"/>
            <p>members that usually sit in parliament; and these prizes may with some propriety be called representatives. Thus, new parliaments may be called in a few days time, all disputes about unfair elections prevented, all bribery and corruption for votes quite annihilated; and, in order to the greater freedom of parliaments, and that the persons who have been blanked, might be reinstated in the hopes of serving their country some time or other, the institution of annual parliaments would not be amiss, or at least the term of their duration ought not to exceed three years. - What think you now, Sir? (cried my uncle Dick with a hearty laugh, and catching hold of the minister's hand, and shaking it lustily as if he had been very familiar with him,) tell me, have not I hit the nail on the head? Aye, and drove it in straight, and clenched it so cleverly on the other side, that it will be the stoutest hold-fast you can find to all you wish and want.'</p>
            <pb n="196" xml:id="pb-196" facs="#i202"/>
            <p>"I must say, (answered the minister) that you have much mended the matter. I little expected its being brought to this issue; and yet the method is so simple, plain and obvious, and withal so productive of a general satisfaction, that I am surprized it has not been thought of and proposed before now. 'Tis true, balloting for parliament men has often been recommended, but not that I know of, with the precautions you have hinted in your first scheme, nor the evident utility accruing to the state by the second. The latter is best calculated for general elections, and the former, in case of death, for particular ones. - I wish some lovers of their country would labour strenuously to have both adopted, and make their use permanent. I myself shall use my best endeavours to promote them. - Things, as they now stand and have long prevailed by custom, I must frankly acknowledge, are not to my mind. Experience has taught us how pernicious they have been in their consequences. If some men</p>
            <pb n="197" xml:id="pb-197" facs="#i203"/>
            <p>of integrity have by their influence made laws, and enacted severe penalties against bribery and corruption in candidates for seats in parliament and their electors, what fruits have been reaped from such laudable intentions, when they have been, and can be counteracted, eluded and brought to nought by the interest of superior powers, an interest in its tendency connections and effects known to be separate from, if not repugnant to the interest of the nation? Hence, arises that ardour, that earnestness in p-t c-d-s to secure their e-n. Were they not sensible that they should repay themselves with usury by places, pensions, perquisites, and private donations, they would scarce bustle about so vehemently in purchasing votes for the pure love of the country. I allow, many come to the h-se with incorrupt hearts, and perhaps with resolutions to plead the genuine cause of their country; but the gilded bait is made to play so enticingly before them; is made to fascinate them by so many plausible</p>
            <pb n="198" xml:id="pb-198" facs="#i204"/>
            <p>pretexts for acceptance, that at last it is inconsiderately catched at: down it goes and it may be sweet in the deglutition, though afterwards upon concoction and rumination as gravel in the mouth; or if it should not affect in that manner, it may so tenaciously adhere to the parts it first fastened on, that the patient ever after will be a valetudinarian in politics, and always betraying in his actions some wretched symptoms of misgoverning principles."</p> <p>My uncle Dick, and indeed all the company with him could not forbear breaking out into rapturous eulogiums on the minister's unministerial way of speaking his mind. - 'What his honour has said is very true; aye, before George, as true as the gospel, (continued my uncle Dick, whirling his cap in a three times repeated huzza about his head;) 'but an annual, biennial, or at farthest, a triennial p-t according to my projection, will radically cure this inveterate malady.' Then turning to the minister, 'I conceive</p>
            <pb n="199" xml:id="pb-199" facs="#i205"/>
            <p>good Sir, with Pliny, that as in men's * bodies, so also in commonwealths, the disease is most grievous and dangerous, which proceeds from the head. If there is no corruption in the source, there will be none in the streams and rivulets branching from it. If care be taken to detect sycophants, and to keep them from steering at the helm, the ship will come safe into port under the unerring direction of experienced pilots. - Well, now I recollect a sentence of Tacitus, which fits what we have been saying as tight as a glove: "The â  leading men, according as every one of them was disposed for slavery, were raised to wealth and honours." - There's the mischief of a long p-t! Government in such hands grows languid, or at best can only exert the vis inertiae, <note>Latin</note>or passive force. - But is there no remedy for this capital disorder? Yes, I can</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Lib. 4. Ep.</p> <p>â  Caeteri nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus &amp; honoribus extollerentur, Lib. I. Cap. I. Annal.</p>

However, he would take an opportunity another time to confer with him on that head; that in itself it implied nothing impracticable; and if so, it would be the result of Plato's fine notions, 'That republics must be happy, when kings exercised themselves in the practical study of philosophy, or philosophers governed.'</p> <p>At the close of these words, looking at his watch, he said it was time for him to withdraw.

            <p>respect to him; and as he was taking his leave, he told my father, that he hoped, from the scientific appearance of his physicians, he would be put on the right road of begetting a boy to his mind, and that he himself should repute it a favour done him, if in ten months hence he was invited to be a sponsor at his baptism.</p> <p>CHAP. XVIII.</p> <p>ONE should think at the minister's departure every thing ministerial ought to have departed along with him; but my uncle Dick still made such a boast of the accuracy of his political genius, and so filled the heads of the company with new plans, schemes, projects, forms, modes, constitutions, essences, and quintessences of government, that my father had all the difficulty in the world to govern their tongues, and reduce them to silence. It was necessary, at least he thought so himself, that an itch after loquaciousness</p>
            <pb n="202" xml:id="pb-202" facs="#i208"/>
            <p>should be allayed by reservedness, that a hurry of spirits should subside into tranquillity, that dissipation should be banished by attention, in a word, that no obstruction should intervene to disconcert his physicians, as now they were to unfold, lay open, display, expand all the treasures of their knowledge for making him an adept of thorough proficiency in the process of the male-generating Arcanum.</p> <p>Having received the word of command from my father to make ready, they forthwith stroaked their beards, crisped their whiskers, fiddled with the tails of their wigs, roughed their eyebrows; in fine, they distorted all the features of their faces into, - I don't know which - such solemn or sullen aspects, that some, especially the women, who smiled, and whispered, and tittered at the whim of the gesticulating prelude, were quickly chilled into horrors by a second peep at their wry looks. - The Squire, who dearly loved a bit of mischief, asked my</p>

(cried my father,) shall I never hear an end of all this nonsense? - Never mind them, good Sirs; (turning to the physicians;)</p>
            <pb n="204" xml:id="pb-204" facs="#i210"/>
            <p>I'll keep order and silence. - Be pleased to begin now. - Let me hear your sentiments on the knack of male-procreation."</p> <p>"Why, Mr. Montfichet, (said Doctor Blue-beard, with eyes rather more stern, and cheeks more tumified than before,) why, why - it is an essential point to the success of our practice, never to make public our opinions: they are sacred, and cannot bear to be examined into by the uninitiated in their mysterious adjuncts and appellatives. - But if you will, I'll whisper something in your ear." - 'Did not I tell you, (said my grandmother, putting in another word,) that you would hear learning: Marry! it was working in them.' - My father not minding my grandmother no farther than praying her to hold her tongue, told Doctor Blue-beard in terms earnest, positive and peremptory, that he must have their opinions declared candidly and openly; that, as he was not selfish in his views, he aimed at a general benefit; that such was</p>
            <pb n="205" xml:id="pb-205" facs="#i211"/>
            <p>the intention of procuring this meeting; and that he expected, without any more tergiversation, the opening of the consult from Doctor Blue-beard himself, who affected to be the archiater and president.</p> <p>No more time could be spent in idle apologies, or ostentatious signs of science, and Doctor Blue-beard withal surmizing that his fee might be with-held from him, unless he delivered something by word of mouth, and not in the way of prescription, (which he offered, and my father rejected, authenticated and dignified by the occult yet pompous marks of Sol, Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercurius, Luna and Venus, amalgamating the whole into an ens veneris) <note>Latin</note> - he ventured, - after scratching and re-scratching his head, rubbing his nose, eyes and temples, biteing his nails, jogging and see-sawing his body in his chair, cracking his hand-knuckles, tossing by re-iterated turns his legs over one another, and humming, hawing, hauking and hiccupping, - to utter these words, as his final and definitive</p>

            <p>sentence: "You will get a boy, whenever God pleases you should get one." - 'Zounds! (cried my father) the midwife told me the self same thing. - I make no doubt of a particular Providence; many instances can be produced of its interposition: but as God has established certain general laws in nature for producing certain effects, he has vested our free-agency with the power of making these laws particular in regard to ourselves. - I do not want here Father Mallebranche's system of Occasional Causes to help me out: It derogates from the wisdom of God to make him interfere in all our actions, and he must be a very bad philosopher who cannot advance sufficient reasons, without having recourse continually to God's concurrence. Neither, on the other hand, if I reject Mallebranche's notions, do I approve of Leibnitz's Pre-established Harmony. My soul cannot be, as it would fain make it, a spiritual automaton; nor my body a machine, which God has so constructed, that the laws of</p>

His head turned towards his left shoulder with a fixed side-faced proud look, his hands were placed a kimbow, and his chest bulged out. In this position, he thought fit to inculcate this important sentence, "That whenever my father kissed my mother, if he happened to get a boy, he would have one; and if he did not, he would not.' - "There's no * occasion for a ghost to come from hell to tell us that;" was all the animadversion my father made,</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* A saying in Shakespeare's Hamlet.</p>

There are therefore two particulars which are principally conducive to the propagation of children: the first the genital moisture, which partly flows from the brain and the whole body, and partly from the liver, which may be aptly called the blood's laboratory. The second, the spirit that flows through the arteries from the heart, by the force of which the parts are erected, and by the impulse of which also the seminal matter rushes forth and is ejaculated. To these may be added the appetite and desire of coition, which may have a variety of stimulating principles to excite it.</p> <p>We commonly see barren lands made fruitfnl by culture and the industry of men: useless stumps of trees, and trees themselves thought sick and decayed, have with care been revived into a plentiful production of excellent fruits; in like manner the medical art in cultivating and improving the field for human procreation, ought to labour strenuously to remedy the faults and imperfections of nature, and by reducing to a temperament the languid heat, the tine and small quantity of spirits, the dryness that accompanies a coldness of constitution, the weakness of the parts and nerves, to remove all impediments and obstructions that frustrate the expectation of an offspring.</p> <p>Now, as aliments have the properties of changing</p>
            <pb n="210" xml:id="pb-210" facs="#i216"/>
            <p>me so. - The rest of the company, I except your brethren, will judge the same of</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note><p>even the elementary qualities, and bringing a bad habit of body into a better; it is necessary that men thus circumstanced, should have recourse to a diet, by which nature is made fruitful and fitted for propagation. Amongst the particulars that excite Venus, and are accommodated for promoting fecundity in women, hot and moist meats are the most commendable, as containing good juices, nourishing well, and rendering the body lively and succulent. Galen says, that the substance of the semen is prepared and composed of the purest and best digested, and also flatulent superfluity of the blood. Some eatables therefore have the efficacy of encreasing and accumulating the semen, and others of procuring a stimulus, and propelling the humour. Those that supply the matter, are eggs, pheasants, thrushes, black-birds, fig-peckers, woodcocks, snipes, young pigeons, sparrows, partridges, capons, cockarels, almonds, pine-apples, raisins of the sun and corants, all generous, sweet and pure wines, especially those expressed from the muscadel grape, and therefore called muscadine. Those that erect and stimulate the parts are satyrion, eringo, nasturtium, wild cresses or hedge mustard, parsnips, artichokes, onions, turneps, rape-roots, asparagus, preserved ginger, galangal, acorus, scallions, shell-fish, and the herb rocket. For, as we see pieces of heavy artillery crammed with powder and ball, discharge with great impetuosity by the application of a lighted match; so in this work two things should necessarily concur that the effort might not be in vain, namely,</p>
            <pb n="211" xml:id="pb-211" facs="#i217"/>
            <p>you; and you might have seen them, had you cast your eyes about you; hang</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>the sufficient stock of conglobated semen, and a certain force of the flatulent spirit, whereby the semen may have a just explosion and find a lodgement in the recesses of the uterus.</p> <p>The proper precautions now supposed, an opportunity for succeeding must be attended to. This opportunity will serve when the catamenia have ceased; for until they are cleared off, the seminal matter cannot have a coalition nor ferment, nor the womb conceive. Then the work being completed, the woman may turn gently on her right side, and with her head rather low and bending downwards, and the same inclination in her body, compose herself to sleep. Thus the seminal matter resting upon the right sinus of the womb, will form the rudiments of a male child. However, the season of the year, the climate, the circumstance of age and aliments, are things of great moment in this case. The summer, if not too hot, is best adapted to the conceiving of a male; because the semen and menstrual blood receive an additional heat from the quality of the ambient air. A warm climate also, adult years and of full puberty with rough, hairy bodies are best for the producing of males.</p> <p>There are many things besides, which by their specific and latent virtues are in this respect of singular efficacy. The herb mercury, distinguished into male and female, is said to be very powerful towards the production of the sex of its kind; so that, if a decoction of the juice of the male be drank four days from the first day of purgation, it gives the womb the</p>
            <pb n="212" xml:id="pb-212" facs="#i218"/>
            <p>down their heads ashamed of your behaviour. - But now I see the vanity of imputing</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>force of procreating a male child; the juice of the female taken as many days and in the same manner, is of the like effect for the procreation of a female child, especially if the man and woman come together after the ceasing of the catamenia: and, for this reason, I suppose, that the male mercury clears, and cherishes with heat the right sinus and cavity of the womb, and the female the left. Whence it comes to pass that the cold humour being drawn off and evacuated, the woman is well prepared for conceiving. For, as in a wet or marshy ground the seeds of plants are suffocated, neither do they easily shoot out into a stalk; so from the redundancy of the cold humour the  seminal matter undergoes a strangulation, and to such a degree, that the powers and faculties of the womb, cannot work out the form of any species of sex. For remedying this humidity of the uterus, there are some medicines not unlike in their effect, as the Marseilles hartwort, sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, xylocasia, zedoary, lignum aloes, the berb pellitory, the species of calamint, clary, dittany, elecampane, the root of the flower-de-luce, assa foetida, and many others of the like sort, which discuss flatulencies, and cleanse places incumbered with many unseemly things, and withal, as a fine tilth, prepare them for sowing. There are other medicines different from those mentioned, in their operations, being of great service to clear away the mucus of the womb, and so by removing the cause of its lubricity, to make the semen more tenaciously inhere to it. Of this kind are amber,</p>

            <p>science to any class of men, or thinking it inherent to them from any characteristical</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>the shavings of ivory, styrax calamita, hartshorn, sumach, blatta byzantia, myrtle-seed, cypress-nuts, olibanum or frankincense, mastich, the herb Britannica or spoonwort, clove gilly-flowers, five leaved-grass, and red roses. Of these, some outwardly applied, and some taken inwardly, strengthen the womb, and having consumed and dried up the superfluous moisture, brace it, and introduce a degree of astringency capable of retaining the semen. Women not subject to be disordered in this manner, may suffer by its contrary, aridity, which brings on hysteric affections, with the diversity of symptoms they appear in. The case is easily remedied by medicines and aliments that moderately humect.</p> <p>It will not be amiss to advise those who are willing to be an honour and ornament to the married state by a numerous offspring, to come together by intervals and at stated times, that frequency might not exceed what is requisite, nor abstinence fall short of what is expedient. Both are of great prejudice to fruitfulness. Immoderate seminal profusions exhaust the strength and depopulate the spirits. On the other hand, to contain longer than is meet, makes the semen less strong and of less effect. The most convenient time also ought to be a point of consideration, together with a due reflection on the sex the married pair desire to procreate.</p> <p>Avicenna, no mean author, describes the time and manner of procreation. When, says he, the catamenia have ceased flowing, and the uterus is cleansed,</p>

            <p>mark. However, bought wit is best, and experience makes fools wise-men.</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>which usually happens to fifth or seventh day, if the man and woman should come together, from the first day of her purgation to the fifth, a male is produced; from the fifth to the eighth, a female; again from the eighth to the twelfth, a male; and after this number of days, an hermaphrodite. Tho' he assigns no cause of these effects, one notwithstanding which seems very probable, occurs. The first days the humour being well purged off, the uterus contains more heat, whereby the seminal matter acquires a more powerful coalescence, and is directed into the right sinus of the uterus, by the attractive force of the liver and the right rein, from which, also, during those days, warm blood flows for the nourishment of the future foetus: the left parts, as cold and destitute of blood, cannot contribute any thing immediately after the purgation; but the blood filtrates later and in a smaller quantity from the veins of the left part, which are called emulgent, and permeate the spleen and left rein, so that after the fifth day to the eighth, some blood flows from them for the nourishment of the foetus, which in regard to the situation of the place, and the cold aliment received, proves to be a female. After the eighth day the right parts resume the function of contributing blood, which accordingly again begins to flow for the nourishment of a male. And, as after the course of these days the blood flows promiscuously from all parts, and the loca are made too moist by the afflux of the frigid humour, and the semen cannot be associated to either part, but fluctuates in the</p>

            <p>I may have reason in some sense to regret what I have done, but I do not; I</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>midst of the uterus, this confusion may occasion an hermaphrodite, which being conceived, receives its form, now from the right, and now from the left sinus, and so becomes the result of the operation of both.</p> <p>Lactantius is of * opinion, that a male child may be procreated, tho' the man's semen is lodged in the left part of the uterus; but because the conception is performed in the part destined for procreating females, it will retain something womanish, as the delicacy of shape and features, a skin whiter and smoother than is common to men, the carnose parts not firm or compact, a small shrill voice, a thin beard; in short, a mind disposed to nothing manly, and continually haunted with fears and superstitious notions. On the other hand, if the woman's semen flows in upon the right side, a female may be procreated; but being conceived in a part foreign to her, she will be endowed with a virility unconsonant to the sex, as strong limbs, high stature, a brown colour, rough face, bold look, robust voice, and a manly and courageous heart. Women of this constitution generally shaking off the yoke of obedience, play the master over their husbands, and assume so much authority in the administration of family concerns both within and without doors, that no man, far from contradicting or rebuking them, dares even to plead a reasonable remonstrance.</p> <p>All naturalists and physicians, (making an allowance in regard to the principles of generation, for</p> <note>footnote</note> <p>* Lib. de Opific.</p>

            <p>have studied men by it, and I have proved the truth of the saying, that 'one must eat</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>the good habit and disposition of the human body,) agree, that the right side partakes of the greater quantity of genial heat, and that if a woman retains the seminal matter on the right side, she will conceive a male, and if in the left, a female. It is possible to be convinced of this by ocular demonstration in multiparous animals: for if a pregnant sow is opened, the males will be found on the right side, and the females on the left. It is therefore women are counselled after the reception of the semen, to lie on the right side. If the right testicle of a ram be tied up, he will only beget ewes. When a bull covers a cow or heifer, it may be easily known by certain signs what sex he has generated: if he has leaped on the right side, it is manifest he has sowed a bull calf, if on the left, a cow calf. Wherefore the antient Egyptians to signify a woman that had brought forth a daughter, painted a bull looking to the left; but if a son, a bull turning to the right.</p> <p>Imagination too, in respect to generation is often attended with some very singular effects. It has been found at the time of conception to determine the formation of the foetus; for women by taking a fancy to, or being very fond of certain pictures and statues, have been delivered of children like them. There have been accounts of the birth of black children, and of others all over hairy. after an intricate investigation of the cause, pictures and images were found affixed to the walls opposite beds in chambers, on which women being to some measure intent and</p>

            <p>a peck of salt with another before he knows him.'</p> <p>My uncle Dick, more hot by far and more satyrical than my father, added by way of supplement to his words, before any of the medical wiseacres could purge their intellects of the gross humours which made so strange an eruption in their opinions, - that the consultors, and the result of their consultation, were so like Mr.</p> <note>continuation of footnote</note> <p>looking stedfastly during the act of matrimonial duty; they were afterwards, from this force of imagination, from this affecting thought, delivered of a striking resemblance in the offspring to the obejcts represented. Hence, in order to have beautiful and comely children, it would be very proper to decorate the bed-chamber with the pictures and images of Cupid, Adonis, and Ganymeded, or some solid matter representing the parents. The woman in the exercise of Venus, will revolve the pleasing idea in her mind; imagination will paint the lovely form in all the symmetry of its winning beauties; and the pregnant mother by frequently reviving the contemplation whilst she so continues, will express on the child an exact imitation of the charms and graces her heart so much desired.</p> <p>but of the force of imagination in this and other respects, I shall endeavour to discourse more particularly and more at large in some future volume of this work.</p>

            <p>Nobody and his puff, of what he could do, that had not Punch reconnoitred and made a proper discovery of his Nothingness, all the rest of the Puppets overawed by his strutting Majesty, would have revered him as a Personage of vast consequence. - My uncle Dick also did not forget the citing of very pertinent apothegms from the most approved ancient authors, some excellent morals from AEsop's fables, particularly that of the mountain in labour, together with a summary of the deliberations of the wise men of Gotham, on causes physical and mechanical, why a house is bigger than a mouse-hole, all which he seasoned cum grano salis <note>Latin</note></p> <p>The Parson, Squire and women laughed most immoderately, whilst my uncle Dick was diverting himself with rough-wiping and bye-cutting the butts of his jocularity; and if the butts offered to interrupt him, as they did several times, he would that instant syringe their ears with ingredients of more acrid and pungent qualities, or erect the corrugative muscles of their noses by</p>

            <p>the stimulus of stink-pots. These stink-pots were no other than a mass of pills moulded out of the huge stock of their own good sense, reason and learning. The odour of them should have been agreeable to their nostrils, as all give the preference to their own dirt; but because they were laid under their noses against their will, and by a groom of the stool they had not commissioned, it made them, foorsooth, quite nauseabund.</p> <p>When my uncle Dick had ceased, more out of fatigue from fast speaking, than having spoke enough, high and angry words arose between my father and the physicians, especially on their demanding the promised fee of twenty guineas a piece. My father assured them with great resolution and firmness, that they should not have a farthing of his money; that they advised nothing deserving of it; that any old wife in the parish would have said much more and more to the purpose; and, as to their threatning him with the law, (which the physicians did,) he believed</p>
            <pb n="220" xml:id="pb-220" facs="#i226"/>
            <p>that the law would neither award nor adjudge any thing in their favour; it would be only a quantum meruerunt, <note>Latin</note>and it was evident that they deserved nothing; but that if they flattered themselves they had, and were intent thereupon to commence a law-suit, he could have the pleasure of seeing his case stated as well as they, before the reverend, the judges of the King's Bench.</p> <p>The Physicians did not find one that would take their part. The Squire, harlequin like, played a thousand tricks on them, and mimicked all their words and motions. A person that finds himself disagreeable to a company, should leave it directly and not expose himself to further insults. It was not so with the physicians; they stood their ground unabashed, and would have spun out the altercation 'till doomsday, solliciting the payment of their fees, had not my uncle Dick rouzed their sensibility for sallying forth, by threatning to burn them alive with his speculum ustorium. Then, indeed, they began to think</p>
            <pb n="221" xml:id="pb-221" facs="#i227"/>
            <p>seriously that the place would be too hot for them: they scouted away like wild fire; but whether they made use in their return of the tardy vehicle of their wheel-barrows, is a piece of intelligence I could never get any just information of.</p> <p>My father now cured of his itch for consulting physicians, wanted to have his mind unbent from the vexation that had fretted and ruffled its usual serenity. Every one strove, who should contribute most to his recreation. The Parson and Squire, both boon and inoffensive companions, were pressed to spend the evening; and my grandmother told them good beds should not be wanting to them. The punch-bowl was replenished. An elegant supper was prepared. My uncle Dick played on all his instruments of musick, and told many diverting stories. There was some dancing. All went to bed quite easy in mind, and satisfied with each other. Towards morning my mother conceived with child. My father was in great hopes, that, his and my mother's imagination</p>

            <p>being heated with the thoughts and desires of getting a boy, it would be a boy in reality; and my mother prevailed upon my father, if it should prove to be a boy, to call him BERTRAM, alluding to her own name BERTRAM, alluding to her own name BERTHA; not for any respect to its German original, which she knew, my father, as a true Englishman, was not much affected to; but because it was a good name in its signification, importing as an eminent linguist had once explained it to her, fair, illustrious, bright, or famous. - Having agreed upon these premises, they continued in warm expectations of the event.</p> <p>CHAP. XIX.</p> <p>AS these second volume of this Life and these Opinions, must in this chapter be wound up into a conclusion, the gentle Reader cannot expect that I should trespass against the rules of decency, much less against the rules of the biography I</p>

            <p>have prescribed to myself, by launching out into a greater depth of narrative, or at least giving him a memorandum of the heads of the things, persons, and opinions I purpose to execute hereafter. By so doing I should leave an open for every paultry scribbler to comment insipidly upon my subject matter, and palm it upon the Public as the sequel of the genuine Life and Opinions of Bertram Montfichet, Esq; No, no; I give fair warning against such surreptitious dealings, and I cordially advise my friend the Black Goose in Paternoster-Row, that she will stick none of her feathers in my tail by the name of a third, or fourth, or fifth, or sixth volume.</p> <p>But, perhaps, this same black Goose, or some other Goose might cackle to me: "Who are you? Are you a Swan of such downy plumage? Is your melody so sweet and enchanting? IS it so important in its consequences, that I should trouble myself to catch a penny by humming a tune after it?

            <p>will you do to spirit yourself up to a continuance of them?</p> <p>Don't fret and vex yourself, and I will tell you what I have done, and what I shall do. - I have exceeded Tristram Shandy, Gent. in the art of Retrogradation. Remember, where he finished his two first volumes, he was just born; and where I may be said to have finished, I was just begotten, or not much more than begotten. besides his superiority, not to mention the variety of style and manner, who will say that my matter is not preferable to his? His uncle Toby is not the thousandth part so clever a fellow as my uncle Dick; his father is not able to hold a candle to mine; in fine, his whole family do nothing but scamper about on hobby horses; whereas the honourable Montfichet family, seem mounted, all and every one of them, on winged Pegasus's, or if any of them chuse to go a fox-hunting, they never want a Bucephalus, as proud to carry them as if they were Alexanders the Great.</p>

            <p>This is what I have done; - and what I shall do, will be to review all the opinions in the world, that by making them stand the test of right reason, I may divest them of prejudice nad passion, - and separate the erroneous from the judicious. - A mighty task! How shall I be able to get through with it? But I have one consolation to push forward, and give fresh life to my hopes whenever they begin to flag; and this is, that i have by me, safe and sound, the memoirs of that profound sage, my uncle Dick. By following the light they give, if I fail in the attempt of making mankind better and wiser than they are, I shall have the satisfaction to think that my intentions were laudable; and all will probably have some sparks of gratitude amidst cool reflection to think so with me, though they may have acted, and may again act otherwise than I would have them.</p> <p>Where unerring truth cannot reign, there opinion must. But, how few are the things that bear the marks of incontestable</p>
            <pb n="226" xml:id="pb-226" facs="#i232"/>
            <p>truth, and how many are characterized as opinions! Even on the same thing what a diversity of opinions! How shall it be decided, which is the most elegible, and which comes nearest truth? - All that can be done is to offer a rational conjecture, and this should seem of no effect towards grounding us in a right opinion, towards exciting our approbation of one that is probable and passable, towards inducing us to discard that which is false and ridiculous, unless, as I just mentioned, we divest ourselves of all prejudices and passions. - The prejudices of infancy and education give birth to all others. We should not be so tenacious of our religious and political opinions, were we not born to, and brought up with them. Few give themselves the trouble to examine whether they are worthy of the assent of reasonable beings; and if they are admonished to examine, their sudden resentment shews how loath they are to part with the darlings. 'Tis certain, they cannot help sometimes seeing into the folly of their</p>
            <pb n="227" xml:id="pb-227" facs="#i233"/>
            <p>caprichios, but long and strong habits create so many pretinesses of intimate familiarity, that they cannot and will not be prevailed upon to break off the acquaintance. - A true Mussulman will hardly thank a Christian Republican for informing him, that with regard to both politics and religion, he is in as bad, and as dangerous a situation as can be. The Turk smiles with contempt when he hears, that whole provinces and nations must be very wretched by suffering themselves to be controlled by the despotic and arbitrary government of one person, which considered in any light whatsoever, must be an incongruity in nature, and an affront upon the dignity of mankind: But fondness for his religion works more powerfully on him. What indignant emotions swell his breast, when the truth of its dogma's, to him sacred and inspiring reverential awe, are called in question! How atrocious is the crime to accuse it of fallacy! Mahomet cannot be an imposter in his opinion, and he as firmly believes that the poisoned roasted shoulder of mutton</p>
            <pb n="228" xml:id="pb-228" facs="#i234"/>
            <p>spoke to Mahomet, advising him not to eat of it, as the Christian believes any of the miracles recited in the gospel.</p> <p>Thus it is that opinion governs all the world; it sets a price upon virtue, and the reputation of him, who raises a hue and cry after fame to sound a trumpet in his favour, may alone make his designs pass as good and lawful. But it is the business of reason to take off the mask, or to rub off the specious gloss, and by diligent inspection to be assured whether all be found within. If the opinionist does not diligently pursue this method, he will be continually infatuated with the belief of absurdities. Numa Pompilius held private consultations with the goddess Egeria. Cromwel went frequently to seek the Lord. Those who had a good opinion of both, were persuaded that both had really such a familiar intercourse with the Divinity, and that consequently whatever they proposed, came from above. But they might believe with as good reason, that the Fox had no other view than the sanctification of his auditory, when he</p>

Secondly, that if some things related appear to him as alluding to the present times, he will be pleased to consider them</p>

            <p>as long ago past, or if he can't be made obsequious to that notion, he will be so good as to fence me round against the critics rage by the authority of a prolepsis or anticipation.</p> <p>And now, had not a prolepsis thrown in my way by the Author of the Tale of a Tub, precluded me from paying my tribute of gratitude to the public for their favourable acceptance of this most excellent Life, and these most excellent Life, and these most excellent Opinions, I should undoubtedly, in an humble disposition of mind, thank all orders of men and women in this kingdom; but in a more especial manner, my worthy friends the critics of both sexes, that detail and retail their judgments int he Reviews. I am fully convinced of their upright intentions to deal amicably with me; and for the eulogiums they shall bestow on these and all the future volumes of this work, I will embrace some proper opportunity of making them a suitable return in something more substantial than thanks.</p> <p>FINIS.</p> <note>library stamp reads 'BIBLCANTACAD'</note>
