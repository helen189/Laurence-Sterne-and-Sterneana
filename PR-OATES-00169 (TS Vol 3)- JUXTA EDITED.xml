             <p>OF</p>
             <p>TRISTRAM SHANDY, Gent.</p>
             <p>CHAP. I.</p>
             <p>- "I Wish, Dr. Slop," quoth my uncle Toby (repeating his wish for Dr. Slop a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in his manner of wishing, than he had wished it at first*) - "I wish, Dr. Slop," quoth my uncle Toby, "you had seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders."</p>
             <note>below is a footnote</note>
             <p>* Vid. Vol. II. p. 159.</p>
             
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i12"/>
             <p> My uncle Toby's wish did Dr. Slop a disservice which his heart never intended any man, - Sir, it confounded him - and thereby putting his ideas first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for the soul of him.</p>
             <p>In all disputes, - male or female, - whether for honour, for profit or for love, - it makes no difference in the case; - nothing is more dangerous, madam, than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man: the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish, is, for the party wished at, instantly to get up upon his legs - and wish the wisher something in return, of pretty near the same value, - so balancing the account upon the spot, you stand as you were - nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by it.</p>

             <p>This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes. -</p>
             <p>Dr. Slop did not understand the nature of this defence; - he was puzzled with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a half; - five had been fatal to it: - my father saw the danger - the dispute was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, "Whether the child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with one:" - he waited to the last moment to allow Dr. Slop, in whose behalf the wish was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, I say, that he was confounded, and continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare with, - first in my uncle Toby's face - then in his - then up - then down - then</p>

             <p>east - east and by east, and so on, - coasting it along by the plinth of the wainscot till he had got to the opposite point of the compass, - and that he had actually begun to count the brass nails upon the arm of his chair - my father thought there was no time to be lost with my uncle Toby, so took up the discourse as follows.</p>
             <p>CHAP. II.</p>
             <p>" - WHAT prodigious armies you had in Flanders!" -</p>
             <p>Brother Toby, replied my father, taking his wig from off his head with his right hand, and with his left pulling out a striped India handkerchief from his right coat pocket, in order to rub his head,</p>
             
             <pb n="9" xml:id="pb-9" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>as he argued the point with my uncle Toby. - </p>
             <p>- Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I will give you my reasons for it.</p>
             <p>Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than, "Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his left," - have divided the greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed them, to totter upon their heads. - But need I tell you, Sir, that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is begirt, give every thing in this world its size and shape; - and by tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what it is - great - little - good - bad - indifferent</p>
             
             <pb n="10" xml:id="pb-10" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>or not indifferent, just as the case happens.</p>
             <p>As my father's India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket, he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged: on the contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to have committed that entirely to the left; and then, when the natural exigency my father was under of rubbing his head, call'd out for his handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world to have done, but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken it out; - which he might have done without any violence, or the least ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his whole body.</p>
             <p>In this case, (unless indeed, my father</p>
             
             <pb n="11" xml:id="pb-11" facs="#i17"/>
             <p>had been resolved to make a fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left hand - or by making some nonsensical angle or other at his elbow joint, or armpit) - his whole attitude had been easy - natural - unforced: Reynolds himself, as great and gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he sat.</p>
             <p>Now, as my father managed this matter, - consider what a devil of a figure my father made of himself.</p>
             <p>- In the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, and in the beginning of the reign of King George the first, - "Coat pockets were cut very low down in the skirt." - I need say no more - the father of mischief, had he had been hammering at it a month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my father's situation.</p>
             
             <pb n="12" xml:id="pb-12" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>CHAP. III.</p>
             <p>IT was not an easy matter in any king's reign, (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat-pocket. - In the year, one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of St. Nicholas; - the idea of which drew off his attention so entirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up Trim, to go and fetch his map of Namur, and his compasses and sector</p>
             
             <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>along with it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack, - but particularly of that one, where he received his wound upon his groin.</p>
             <p>My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in his body seemed to rush up into his face - my uncle Toby dismounted immediately.</p>
             <p>- I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was o'horseback. -</p>
             <p>CHAP. IV.</p>
             <p>A Man's body and his mind, with the utmost reverence to both I speak it, are exactly like a jerkin, and a jerkin's lining; - rumple the one - you rumple the other. There is one certain exception however in this case, and that is,</p>
             
             <pb n="14" xml:id="pb-14" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your jerkin made of a gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it, of a sarcenet or thin persian.</p>
             <p>Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes, Babylonius, Dyonisius Heracleotes, Antipater, Panaetius and Possidonius amongst the Greeks; - Cato and Varro and Seneca amongst the Romans; - Pantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and Montaigne amongst the Christians; and a score and a half of good honest, unthinking, Shandean people as ever lived, whose names I can't recollect, - all pretended that their jerkins were made after this fashion, - you might have rumpled and crumpled, and doubled and creased, and fretted and fridged the outsides of them all to pieces; - in short, you might have played the very devil with them, and at the same time, not</p>
             
             <pb n="15" xml:id="pb-15" facs="#i21"/>
             <p>one of the insides of 'em would have been one button the worse, for all you had done to them.</p>
             <p>I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after this sort: - for never poor jerkin has been tickled off, at such a rate as it has been these last nine months together, - and yet I declare the lining to it, - as far as I am a judge of the matter, it is not a three-penny piece the worse; - pell mell, helter skelter, ding dong, cut and thrust, back stroke and fore stroke, side way and long way, have they been trimming it for me: - had there been the least gumminess in my lining, - by heaven! it had all of it long ago been fray'd and fretted to a thread.</p>
             <p>- You Messrs. the monthly Reviewers!</p>
             
             <pb n="16" xml:id="pb-16" facs="#i22"/>
             <p>- how could you cut and slash my jerkin as you did? - how did you know, but you would cut my lining too?</p>
             <p>Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who will injure none of us, do I recommend you and your affairs, - so God bless you; - only next month, if any one of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at me, as some of you did last MAY, (in which I remember the weather was very hot) - don't be exasperated, if I pass it by again with good temper, - being determined as long as I live or write (which in my case means the same thing) never to give the honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish, than my uncle Toby gave the fly which buzz'd about his nose all dinner time, - "Go, - go poor devil," quoth he, " - get thee gone, - why</p>
             
             <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i23"/>
             <p>should I hurt thee? This world is surely wide enough to hold both thee and me."</p>
             <p>CHAP. V.</p>
             <p>ANY man, madam, reasoning upwards, and observing the prodigious suffusion of blood in my father's countenance, - by means of which, (as all the blood in his body seemed to rush up into his face, as I told you) he must have redden'd, pictorically and scientintically speaking, six whole tints and a half, if not a full octave above his natural colour: - any man, madam, but my uncle Toby, who had observed this, together with the violent knitting of my father's brows, and the extravagant contortion of his body during the whole affair, - would have concluded my father in a rage; and taking that for granted, - </p>
             
             <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i24"/>
             <p>had he been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from two such instruments being put into exact tune, - he would instantly have skrew'd up his, to the same pitch; - and then the devil and all had broke loose - the whole piece, madam, must have been played off like the sixth of Avison Scarlatti - con furia, - like mad. - Grant me patience! - What has con furia, - con strepito, - or any other hurlyburly word whatever to do with harmony?</p>
             <p>Any man, I say, madam, but my uncle Toby, the benignity of whose heart interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion would admit of, would have concluded my father angry and blamed him too. My uncle Toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the pocket-hole; - so sitting still, till</p>
             
             <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>my father had got his handkerchief out of it, and looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible good will - my father at length went on as follows.</p>
             <p>CHAP. VI.</p>
             <p>- "WHAT prodigious armies you had in Flanders!"</p>
             <p>- Brother Toby, quoth my uncle, I do believe thee to be as honest a man, and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God created; - nor is it thy fault, if all the children which have been, may, can, shall, will or ought to be begotten, come with their heads foremost into the world: - but believe me, dear Toby, the accidents which unavoidably way-lay them, not only in the article of our begetting 'em, - though these in my opinion,</p>
             
             <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>are well worth considering, - but the dangers and difficulties our children are beset with, after they are got forth into the world, are enow, - little need is there to expose them to unnecessary ones in their passage to it. - Are these dangers, quoth my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon my father's knee, and looking up seriously in his face for an answer, - are these dangers greater now o'days, brother, than in times past? Brother Toby, answered my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after it, - our forefathers never looked further. - My uncle Toby instantly withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his body gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the cornish of the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks, and the</p>
             
             <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i27"/>
             <p>orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty - he whistled Lillabullero.</p>
             <p>CHAP. VII.</p>
             <p>WHILST my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my father, - Dr. Slop was stamping, and cursing and damning at Obadiah at a most dreadful rate; - it would have done your heart good, and cured you, Sir, for ever, of the vile sin of swearing to have heard him. - I am determined therefore to relate the whole affair to you.</p>
             <p>When Dr. Slop's maid delivered the green bays bag, with her master's instruments in it, to Obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through the strings, and ride with his slung across his body: so undoing the</p>
             
             <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i28"/>
             <p>bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without any more ado, she helped him on with it. However, as this, in some measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in galloping back at the speed Obadiah threatened, they consulted to take it off again; and in the great care and caution of their hearts, they had taken the two strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which, Obadiah, to make all safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his body.</p>
             <p>This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended; but was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw. The instruments, it seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had</p>
             
             <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i29"/>
             <p>so much room to play in it, towards the bottom, (the shape of the bag being conical) that Obadiah could not make a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the tire-tÃªte, forceps and squirt, as would have been enough, had Hymen been taking a jaunt that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when Obadiah accelerated this motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his coach-horse into a full gallop - by heaven! Sir, - the jingle was incredible.</p>
             <p>As Obadiah had a wife and three children. - The turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill consequences of this jingling, never once entered his brain, - he had however his objection, which came home to himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with</p>
             
             <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i30"/>
             <p>the greatest patriots. - "The poor fellow, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle."</p>
             <p>CHAP. VIII.</p>
             <p>AS Obadiah loved wind musick preferably to all the instrumental musick he carried with him, - he very considerately set his imagination to work, to contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition of enjoying it.</p>
             <p>In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted, - nothing is so apt to enter a man's head, as his hat-band: - the philosophy of this is so near the surface - I scorn to enter into it.</p>
             <p>As Obadiah's was a mix'd case, - marks, Sirs, - I say, a mix'd case; for it</p>
             
             <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i31"/>
             <p>was obstretical, - scrip-tical, - squirtical, papistical, - and as far as the coach-horse was concerned in it, - caball-istical - and only partly musical; - Obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first expedient which offered; - so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and gripeing them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb of the other, putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then slipping his hand down to the middle of it, - he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from one end to the other (as you would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings met, - that Dr. Slop must have had three fifths of Job's patience at least to have unloosed them. I think in my conscience, that had NATURE been in one of</p>
             
             <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i32"/>
             <p>her nimble moods, and in humour for such a contest - and she and Dr. Slop both fairly started together - there is no man living who had seen the bag with all that Obadiah had done to it, - and known likewise, the great speed the goddess can make when she thinks proper, who would have had the least doubt remaining in his mind - which of the two would have carried off the prize. My mother, madam, had been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly - at least by twenty knots. - Sport of small accidents, Tristram Shandy! that thou art, and ever will be! had that trial been made for thee, and it was fifty to one but it had, - thy affairs had not been so depress'd - (at least by the depression of thy nose) as they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of making them, which have so often presented themselves in the</p>
             
             <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i33"/>
             <p>course of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so irrecoverably abandoned - as thou hast been forced to leave them! - but 'tis over, - all but the account of 'em, which cannot be given to the curious till I am got out into the world.</p>
             <p>CHAP. IX.</p>
             <p>GREAT wits jump: for the moment Dr. Slop cast his eyes upon his bag (which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle Toby about midwifery put him in mind of it) - the very same thought occurred. - 'Tis God's mercy, quoth he, (to himself) that Mrs. Shandy has had so bad a time of it, - else she might have been brought to bed seven times told, before one half of these knots could have got untied. - But</p>
             
             <pb n="28" xml:id="pb-28" facs="#i34"/>
             <p>here, you must distinguish - the thought floated only in Dr. Slop's mind, without sail or ballast to it, as a simple proposition; millions of which, as your worship knows, are every day swiming quietly in the middle of the thin juice of a man's understanding, without being carried backwards or forwards, till some little gusts of passion or interest drive them to one side.</p>
             <p>A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother's bed, did the proposition the very service I am speaking of. By all that's unfortunate, quoth Dr. Slop, unless I make haste, the thing will actually befall me as it is.</p>
             
             <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i35"/>
             <p>CHAP. X.</p>
             <p>IN the case of knots, - by which, in the first place, I would not be understood to mean slip-knots, - because in the course of my life and opinions, - my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I mention the catastrophe of my great uncle Mr. Hammond Shandy, - a little man, - but of high fancy: - he rushed into the duke of Monmouth's affair: - nor, secondly, in this place, do I mean that particular species of knots, called bow-knots; - there is so little address, or skill, or patience, required in the unloosing them, that they are below my giving any opinion at all about them. - But by the knots I am speaking of, may it please your reverences to believe, that I mean</p>
             
             <pb n="30" xml:id="pb-30" facs="#i36"/>
             <p>good, honest, devilish tight, hard knots, made bona fide, as Obadiah made his; - in which there is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the two ends of the strings through the annulus or noose made by the second implication of them - to get them slipp'd and undone by - I hope you apprehend me.</p>
             <p>In the case of these knots then, and of the several obstructions, which, may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting through life - every hasty man can whip out his penknife and cut through them. - 'Tis wrong. Believe me, Sirs, the most virtuous way, and which both reason and conscience dictate - is to take our teeth or our fingers to them. - Dr. Slop had lost his teeth - his favourite instrument,</p>
             
             <pb n="31" xml:id="pb-31" facs="#i37"/>
             <p>by extracting in a wrong direction, or by some misapplication of it, unfortunately slipping, he had formerly in a hard labour, knock'd out three of the best of them, with the handle of it: - he tried his fingers - alas! the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut close. - The deuce take it! I can make nothing of it either way, cried Dr. Slop. - The trampling over head near my mother's bed side increased. - Pox take the fellow! I shall never get the knots untied as long as I live. - My mother gave a groan - Lend me your penknife - I must e'en cut the knots at last - pugh! - psha! - Lord! I have cut my thumb quite across to the very bone - curse the fellow - if there was not another man midwife within fifty miles - I am undone for this bout - I wish the scoundrel hang'd - I wish he was shot - I wish</p>
             
             <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i38"/>
             <p>all the devils in hell had him for a block-head -</p>
             <p>My father had a great respect for Obadiah, and could not bear to hear him disposed of in such a manner - he had moreover some little respect for himself - and could as ill bear with the indignity offer'd to himself in it.</p>
             <p>Had Dr. Slop cut any part about him, but his thumb - my father had pass'd it by - his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his revenge.</p>
             <p>Small curses, Dr. Slop, upon great occasions, quoth my father, (condoling with him first upon the accident) are but so much waste of our strength and soul's health to no manner of purpose. - I own</p>
             
             <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i39"/>
             <p>it, replied Dr. Slop. - They are like sparrow shot, quoth my uncle Toby, (suspending his whistling) fired against a bastion. - They serve, continued my father, to stir the humours - but carry off none of their acrimony: - for my own part, I seldom swear or curse at all - I hold it bad - but if I fall into it, by surprize, I generally retain so much presence of mind (right, quoth my uncle Toby) as to make it answer my purpose - that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy. A wise and a just man however would always endeavour to proportion the vent given to these humours, not only to the degree of them stirring within himself - but to the size and ill intent of the offence upon which they are to fall. - "Injuries come only from the heart," - quoth my uncle Toby. For this reason, continued my father, with the most Cervantick</p>
             
             <pb n="34" xml:id="pb-34" facs="#i40"/>
             <p>gravity, I have the greatest veneration in the world for that gentleman, who, in distrust of his own discretion in this point, sat down and composed (that is at his leisure) fit forms of swearing suitable to all cases, from the lowest to the highest provocations which could possibly happen to him, - which forms being well consider'd by him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he kept them ever by him on the chimney piece, within his reach, ready for use. - I never apprehended, replied Dr. Slop, that such a thing was ever thought of, - much less executed. I beg your pardon - answered my father; I was reading, though not using, one of them to my brother Toby this morning, whilst he pour'd out the tea - 'tis here upon the shelf over my head; - but if I remember right, 'tis too violent for a cut of the</p>
             
             <pb n="35" xml:id="pb-35" facs="#i41"/>
             <p>thumb. - Not at all, quoth Dr. Slop - the devil take the fellow. - Then answered my father, 'Tis much at your service, Dr. Slop - on condition you will read it aloud; - so rising up and reaching down a form of excommunication of the church of Rome, a copy of which, my father (who was curious in his collections) had procured out of the leger-book of the church of Rochester, writ by ERNULPHUS the bishop - with a most affected seriousness of look and voice, which might have cajoled ERNULPHUS himself, - he put it into Dr. Slop's hands. - Dr. Slop wrapt his thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief, and with a wry face, though without any suspicion, read aloud, as follows, - my uncle Toby whistling Lillabullero, as loud as he could, all the time.</p>

I think there is no necessity, quoth Dr. Slop, dropping the paper down to his knee, and addressing himself to my father, - as you have read it over, Sir, so lately, to read it aloud; - and as Captain Shandy seems to have no great inclination to hear it, - I may as well read it to myself. That's contrary to treaty, replied my father, - besides, there is something so whimsical, especially in the latter part of it, I should grieve to lose the pleasure of a second reading. Dr. Slop did not altogether like it, - but my uncle Toby offering at that instant to give</p>

             <p>CHAP. XII.</p>
             <p>NOW don't let us give ourselves a parcel of airs, and pretend that the oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours are our own; and because we have the spirit to swear them, - imagine that we have had the wit to invent them too.</p>
             
             <pb n="57" xml:id="pb-57" facs="#i63"/>
             <p>I'll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the world, except to a connoisseur; - though I declare I object only to a connoisseur in swearing, - as I would do to a connoisseur in painting, &amp;c. &amp;c. the whole set of 'em are so hung round and befetish'd with the bobs and trinkets of criticism, - or to drop my metaphor, which by the bye is a pity, - for I have fetch'd it as far as from the coast of Guinea; - their heads, Sir, are stuck so full of rules and compasses, and have that eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions, that a work of genius had better go to the devil at once, than stand to be prick'd and tortured to death by 'em.</p>

Did no expression of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm? - Was the eye silent? Did you narrowly look? - I look'd only at the stop-watch, my Lord. - Excellent observer!</p>

             <p>I would go fifty miles on foot, for I have not a horse worth riding on, to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will give up the reins of his imagination into his author's hands, - be pleased he knows not why, and cares not wherefore.</p>

             <p>Now to any one else, I will undertake to prove, that all the oaths and imprecations, which we have been puffing off upon the world for these two hundred and fifty years last past, as originals, - except St. Paul's thumb, - God's flesh and God's fish, which were oaths monarchical, and, considering who made them, not much amiss; and as kings oaths, 'tis not much matter whether they were fish or flesh; - else, I say, there is not an oath, or at least a curse amongst them, which has not been copied over and over again out of Ernulphus, a thousand times: but, likes all other copies, how infinitely short of the force and spirit</p>
             
             <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i68"/>
             <p>of the original! - It is thought to be no bad oath, - and by itself passes very well - "G-d damn you." - Set it beside Ernulphus's - "God Almighty the Father damn you, - God the Son damn you, - God the Holy Ghost damn you," - you see 'tis nothing. - There is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up to: besides, he is more copious in his invention, - possess'd more of the excellencies of a swearer, - had such a thorough knowledge of the human frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knittings of the joints, and articulations, - that when Ernulphus cursed, - no part escaped him: - 'Tis true, there is something of a hardness in his manner, - and, as in Michael Angelo, a want of grace, - but then there is such a greatness of gusto! -</p>
             <p>My father, who generally look'd upon</p>
             
             <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i69"/>
             <p>every thing in a light very different from all mankind, - would, after all, never allow this to be an original. - He consider'd rather Ernulphus's anathema, as an institute of swearing, in which, as he suspected, upon the decline of swearing in some milder pontificate, Ernulphus, by order of the succeeding pope, had with great learning and diligence collected together all the laws of it; - for the same reason that Justinian, in the decline of the empire, had ordered his chancellor Tribonian to collect the Roman or civil laws all together into one code or digest, - lest through the rust of time, - and the fatality of all things committed to oral tradition, they should be lost to the world for ever.</p>
             <p>For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not an oath, from</p>
             
             <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i70"/>
             <p>the great and tremendous oath of William the Conqueror, (By the splendour of God) down to the lowest oath of a scavenger, (Damn your eyes) which was not to be found in Ernulphus. - In short, he would add, - I defy a man to swear out of it.</p>
             <p>The hypothesis is, like most of my father's, singular and ingenious too; - nor have I any objection to it, but that it overturns my own.</p>

A scar, an axe, a sword, a pink'd doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a half of pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-halfpenny pickle pot, - but above all, a tender infant royally accoutred. - Tho' if it was too young, and the oration as long as Tully's second Philippick, - it must certainly have beshit the orator's</p>
             
             <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i74"/>
             <p>mantle. - And then again, if too old, - it must have been unwieldy and incommodious to his action, - so as to make him lose by his child almost as much as he could gain by it. - Otherwise, when a state orator has hit the precise age to a minute, - hid his BAMBINO in his mantle so cunningly that no mortal could smell it, - and produced it so critically, that no soul could say, it came in by head and shoulders, - Oh, Sirs! it has done wonders. - It has open'd the sluices, and turn'd the brains, and shook the principles, and unhinged the politicks of half a nation.</p>
             <p>These feats however are not to be done, except in those states and times, I say, where orators wore mantles, - and pretty large ones too, my brethren, with some twenty or five and twenty yards of good</p>

             <p>purple, superfine, marketable cloth in them, - with large flowing folds and doubles, and in great stile of design. - All which plainly shews, may it please your worships, that the decay of eloquence, and the little good service it does at present, both within, and without doors, is owing to nothing else in the world, but short coats, and the disuse of trunk-hose. - We can conceal nothing under ours, Madam, worth shewing.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XV.</p>
             <p>DR. Slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this argumentation: for happening to have his green bays bag upon his knees, when he began to parody my uncle Toby, - 'twas as good as the best mantle in the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence would end in his new</p>

             <p>invented forceps, he thrust his hand into the bag in order to have them ready to clap in, where your reverences took so much notice of the ******, which had he managed, - my uncle Toby had certainly been overthrown: the sentence and the argument in that case jumping closely in one point, so like the two lines which form the salient angle of a raveline, - Dr. Slop would never have given them up; - and my uncle Toby would as soon thought of flying, as taking them by force: but Dr. Slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out, it took off the whole effect, and what was a ten times worse evil (for they seldom come alone in this life) in pulling out his forceps, his forceps unfortunately drew out the squirt along with it.</p>
             <p>When a proposition can be taken in two senses, - 'tis a law in disputation That the respondent may reply to which</p>
             
             <pb n="71" xml:id="pb-71" facs="#i77"/>
             <p>of the two he pleases, or finds most convenient for hm. - This threw the advantage of the argument quite on my uncle Toby's side. - "Good God!" cried my uncle Toby, "are children brought into the world with a squirt?"</p>
             <p>CHAP. XVI.</p>
             <p>- UPON my honour, Sir, you have tore every bit of the skin quite off the back of both my hands with your forceps, cried my uncle Toby, - and you have crush'd all my knuckles into the bargain with them, to a jelly. 'Tis your own fault, said Dr. Slop, - you should have clinch'd your two fists together into the form of a child's head, as I told you, and sat firm. - I did so, answered my uncle Toby. - Then the points of my forceps have not been sufficiently</p>

             <p>arm'd, or the rivet wants closing - or else the cut on my thumb has made me a little aukward, - or possibly - 'Tis well, quoth my father, interrupting the detail of possibilities, - that the experiment was not first made upon my child's head piece. - It would not have been a cherry stone the worse, answered Dr. Slop. I maintain it, said my uncle Toby, it would have broke the cerebellum, (unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a granado) and turned it all into a perfect posset. Pshaw! replied Dr. Slop, a child's head is naturally as soft as the pap of an apple,; - the sutures give way, - and besides, I could have extracted by the feet after. - Not you, said she. - I rather wish you would begin that way, quoth my father.</p>
             <p>Pray do, added my uncle Toby.</p>
             
             <pb n="73" xml:id="pb-73" facs="#i79"/>
             <p>CHAP. XVII.</p>
             <p>- AND pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you to say, it may not be the child's hip, as well as the child's head? - 'Tis most certainly the head, replied the midwife. Because, continued Dr. Slop, (turning to my father) as positive as these old ladies generally are, - 'tis a point very difficult to know, - and yet of the greatest consequence to be known; - because, Sir, if the hip is mistaken for the head, - there is a possibility (if it is a boy) that the forceps  ***************************.</p>
             <p>- What the possibility was, Dr. Slop whispered very low to my father, and then to my uncle Toby. - There is no</p>
             
             <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i80"/>
             <p>such danger, continued he, with the head. - No, in truth, quoth my father, - but when your possibility has taken place at the hip, - you may as well take off the head too.</p>
             <p>- It is morally impossible the reader should understand this, - 'tis enough Dr. Slop understood it; - so taking the green bays bag in his hand, with the help of Obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for a man of his size, across the room to the door, - and from the door was shewn the way, by the good old mid-wife, to my mother's apartment.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XVIII.</p>
             <p>IT is two hours, and ten minutes, - and no more, - cried my father, looking at his watch, since Dr. Slop and</p>
             
             <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i81"/>
             <p>Obadiah arrived, - and I know not how it happens, brother Toby, - but to my imagination it seems almost an age.</p>
             <p>- Here - pray, Sir, take hold of my cap, - nay, take the bell along with it, and my pantoufles too. -</p>
             <p>Now, Sir, they are all at your service; and I freely make you a present of 'em, on condition, you give me all your attention to this chapter.</p>
             <p>Though my father said, "he knew not how it happen'd," - yet he knew very well, how it happen'd; - and at the instant he spoke it, was pre-determined in his mind, to give my uncle Toby a clear account of the matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration</p>
             
             <pb n="76" xml:id="pb-76" facs="#i82"/>
             <p>and its simple modes, in order to shew my uncle Toby, by what mechanism and mensurations in the brain it came to pass, that the rapid succession of their ideas, and the eternal scampering of discourse from one thing to another, since Dr. Slop had come into the room, had lengthened out so short a period, to so inconceivable an extent. - "I know not how it happens, - cried my father, - "but it seems an age."</p>
             <p>- 'Tis owing, entirely, quoth my uncle Toby, to the succession of our ideas.</p>
             <p>My father, who had an itch in common with all philosophers, of reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it too, - proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the succession of ideas, and had not the least apprehension</p>
             
             <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i83"/>
             <p>of having it snatch'd out of his hands by my uncle Toby, who (honest man!) generally took every thing as it happened; - and who, of all men in the world, troubled his brain the least with abstruse thinking; - the ideas of time and space, - or how we came by those ideas, - or of what stuff they were made, - or whether they were born with us, - or we pick'd them up afterwards as we went along, - or whether we did it in frocks, - or not till we had got into breeches, - with a thousand other inquiries and disputes about INFINITY, PRESCIENCE, LIBERTY, NECESSITY, and so forth, upon whose desperate and unconquerable theories, so many fine heads have been turned and crack'd, - never did my uncle Toby's the least injury at all; my father knew it, - and was no less surprised, than he</p>
             
             <pb n="78" xml:id="pb-78" facs="#i84"/>
             <p>was disappointed with my uncle's fortuitous solution.</p>
             <p>Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my father.</p>
             <p>Not I, quoth my uncle.</p>
             <p>- But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk about. -</p>
             <p>No more than my horse, replied my uncle Toby.</p>
             <p>Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping his two hands together, - there is a worth in thy honest ignorance, brother Toby, - 'twere almost a pity to exchange it for a knowledge. - But I'll tell thee. -</p>
             
             <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i85"/>
             <p>To understand what time is aright, without which we never can comprehend infinity, insomuch as one is a portion of the other, - we ought seriously to sit down and consider what idea it is, we have of duration, so as to give a satisfactory account, how we came by it. - What is that to any body? quoth my uncle Toby. * For if you will turn your eyes inwards upon your mind, continued my father, and observe attentively, you will perceive, brother, that whilst you and I are talking together, and thinking and smoaking our pipes: or whilst we receive successively ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist, and so we estimate the existence, or the continuation of the existence, of ourselves, or any thing else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or any such other thing co existing with our</p>

             <p>thinking, - and so according to that preconceived - You puzzle me to death, cried my uncle Toby. -</p>
             <p>= 'Tis owing to this replied my father, that in our computations of time, we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks, and months, - and of clocks (I wish there was not a clock in the kingdom) to measure out their several portions to us, and to those who belong to us, - that 'twill be well, if in time to come, the succession of our ideas be of any use or service to us at all.</p>
             <p>Now, whether we observe it or no, continued my father, in every sound man's head, there is a regular succession of ideas of one sort or other, which follow each other in train just like - A train of artillery? said my uncle Toby. - A train</p>
             
             <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i87"/>
             <p>of a fiddle stick! - quoth my father, - which follow and succeed one another in our minds at certain distances, just like the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of a candle. - I declare, quoth my uncle Toby, mine are like a smoak-jack. - Then, brother Toby, I have nothing more to say to you upon the subject, said my father.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XIX.</p>
             <p>- WHAT a conjuncture was here lost! - My father in one of his best explanatory moods, - in eager pursuit of a metaphysic point into the very regions where clouds and thick darkness would soon have encompassed it about; - my uncle Toby in one of the finest dispositions for it in the world; - his head like a smoak-jack; - the funnel unswept, and the ideas</p>
             
             <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i88"/>
             <p>whirling round and round about in it, all obfuscated and darkened over with fuliginous matter! - By the tomb stone of Lucian - if it is in being, - if not, why then, by his ashes! by the ashes of my dear Rabelais, and dearer Cervantes, - my father and my uncle Toby's discourse upon TIME and ETERNITY, - was a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and the petulancy of my father's humour in putting a stop to it, as he did, was a robbery of the Ontologic treasury, of such a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions and great men, are ever likely to restore to it again.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XX.</p>
             <p>THO' my father persisted in not going on with the discourse, - yet he could not get my uncle Toby's smoak-jack</p>

             <p>out of his head, - piqued as he was at first with it; - there was something in the comparison at the bottom, which hit his fancy; for which purpose resting his elbow upon the table, and reclining the right side of his head upon the palm of his hand, - but looking first stedfastly in the fire, - he began to commune with himself and philosophize about it: but his spirits being wore out with the fatigues of investigating new tracts, and the constant exertion of his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn in the discourse, - the idea of the smoak-jack soon turned all his ideas upside down, - so that he fell asleep almost before he knew what he was about.</p>
             <p>As for my uncle Toby, his smoak-jack had not made a dozen revolutions, before</p>

             <p>he fell asleep also. - Peace be with them both. - Dr. Slop is engaged with the midwife, and my mother above stairs. - Trim is busy in turning an old pair of jack-boots into a couple of mortars to be employed in the siege of Messina next summer, - and is this instant boring the touch holes with the point of a hot poker. - All my heroes are off my hands; - 'tis the first time I have had a moment to spare, - and I'll make use of it, and write my preface.</p>

             <p>THE</p>
             <p>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</p>
             <p>NO, I'll not say a word about it, - here it is; - in publishing it, - I have appealed to the world, - and to the world I leave it; - it must speak for itself.</p>
             <p>All I know of the matter is, - when I sat down, my intent was to write a good book; and as far as the tenuity of my understanding would hold out, - a wise, aye, and a discreet, - taking care only, as I went along, to put into it all the wit and the judgment (be it more or less) which the great author and bestower of them had thought fit originally to give</p>
             
             <pb n="86" xml:id="pb-86" facs="#i92"/>
             <p>me, - so that, as your worships see, - 'tis just as God pleases.</p>
             <p>Now, Agalastes (speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, That there may be some wit in it, for aught he knows, - but no judgment at all. And Triptolemus and Phutatorius agreeing thereto, ask, How is it possible there should? for that wit and judgment in this world never go together; inasmuch as they are two operations differing from each other as wide as east is from west. - So, says Locke, - so are farting and hickuping, say I. But in answer to this, Didius the great church lawyer, in his code de fartandi et illustrandi fallaciis, doth maintain and make fully appear, That an illustration is no argument, - nor do I maintain the wiping of a looking-glass clean, to be a syllogism; - but you all, may it please your worships,</p>
             
             <pb n="87" xml:id="pb-87" facs="#i93"/>
             <p>see the better for it, - so that the main good these things do, is only to clarify the understanding, previous to the application of the argument itself, in order to free it from any little motes, or specks of opacular matter, which if left swiming therein, might hinder a conception and spoil all.</p>
             <p>Now, my dear Anti-Shandeans, and thrice able critics, and fellow-labourers, (for to you I write this Preface) - and to you, most subtle statesman and discreet doctors (do - pull off your beards) renowned for gravity and wisdom; - Monopolos my politician, - Didius, my counsel; Kysarcius, my friend; - Phutatorius, my guide; - Gastripheres, the preserver of my life; Somnolentius, the balm and repose of it, - not forgetting all others as well sleeping as waking, - ecclesiastical as civil, whom for brevity, but out of no</p>

             <p>resentment to you, I lump all together. - Believe me, right worthy,</p>
             <p>My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf, and in my own too, in case the thing is not done already for us, - is, that the great gifts and endowments both of wit and judgment, with every thing which usually goes along with them, - such as memory, fancy, genius, eloquence, quick parts, and what not, may this precious moment without stint or measure, let or hinderance, be poured down warm as each of us could bear it, - scum and sediment an' all; (for I would not have a drop lost) into these veral receptacles, cells, cellules, domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and spare places of our brains, - in such sort, that they might continue to be injected and tunn'd into, according to the true</p>
             
             <pb n="89" xml:id="pb-89" facs="#i95"/>
             <p>intent and meaning of my wish, until every vessel of them, both great and small, be so replenished, saturated and fill'd up therewith, that no more, would it save a man's life, could possibly be got either in or out.</p>
             <p>Bless us! - what noble work we should make! - how should I tickle it off! - and what spirits should I find myself in, to be writing away for such readers! - and you, - just heaven! - with what raptures would you sit and read, - but oh! - 'tis too much, - I am sick, - I faint away deliciously at the thoughts of it! - 'tis more than nature can bear! - lay hold of me, - I am giddy, - I am stone blind, - I'm dying, - I am gone. - Help! Help! Help! - But hold, - I grow something better again, for I am beginning to foresee, when this is over, that as we shall all of us continue</p>
             
             <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i96"/>
             <p>to be great wits, - we should never agree amongst ourselves, one day to an end: - there would be so much satire and sarcasm, - scoffing and flouting, with raillying and reparteeing of it, - thrusting and parrying in one corner or another, - there would be nothing but mischief amongst us. - Chaste stars! what biting and scratching, and what a racket and a clatter we should make, what with breaking of heads, and rapping of knuckles, and hitting of sore places, - there would be no such thing as living for us.</p>
             <p>But then again, as we should all of us be men of great judgment, we should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong; and though we should abominate each other, ten times worse than so many devils or devilesses, we should nevertheless, my dear creatures, be all courtesy</p>
             
             <pb n="91" xml:id="pb-91" facs="#i97"/>
             <p>and kindness, - milk and honey, - 'twould be a second land of promise, - a paradise upon earth, if there was such a thing to be had, - so that upon the whole we should have done well enough.</p>
             <p>All I fret and fume at, and what most distresses my invention at present, is how to bring the point itself to bear; for as your worships well know, that of these heavenly emanations of wit and judgment, which I have so bountifully wished both for your worships and myself, - there is but a certain quantum stored up for us all, for the use and behoof of the whole race of mankind; and such small modicums of 'em are only sent forth into this wide world, circulating here and there in one by corner or another, - and in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious intervals from each other, that one would</p>
             
             <pb n="92" xml:id="pb-92" facs="#i98"/>
             <p>wonder how it holds out, or could be sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many great states, and populous empires.</p>
             <p>Indeed there is one thing to be considered, that in Nova Zembla, North Lapland, and in all those cold and dreary tracts of the globe, which lie more directly under the artick and antartick circles, - where the whole province of a man's concernments lies for near nine months together, within the narrow compass of his cave, - where the spirits are compressed almost to nothing, - and where the passions of a man, with every thing which belongs to them, are as frigid as the zone itself; - there the least quantity of judgment imaginable does the business, - and of wit, - there is a total and an absolute saving, - for as not one spark</p>
             
             <pb n="93" xml:id="pb-93" facs="#i99"/>
             <p>is wanted, - so not one spark is given. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! What a dismal thing would it have been to have governed a kingdom, to have fought a battle, or made a treaty, or run a match, or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a provincial chapter there, with so plentiful a lack of wit and judgment about us! for mercy's sake! let us think no more about it, but travel on as fast as we can southwards into Norway, - crossing over Swedeland, if you please, through the small triangular province of Angermania to the lake of Bothnia; coasting along it through east and west Bothnia, down to Carelia, and so on, through all those states and provinces which border upon the far side of the Gulf of Finland, and the north east of the Baltick, up to Petersbourg, and just stepping into Ingria; - then stretching over directly from thence</p>
             
             <pb n="94" xml:id="pb-94" facs="#i100"/>
             <p>through the north parts of the Russian empire - leaving Siberia a little upon the left hand till we get into the very heart of Russian and Asiatick Tartary.</p>
             <p>Now throughout this long tour which I have led you, you observe the good people are better off by far, than in the polar countries which we have just left: - for if you hold your hand over your eyes, and look very attentively, your may perceive some small glimmerings (as it were) of wit, with a comfortable provision of good plain houshold judgment, which taking the quality and quantity of it together, they make a very good shift with, - and had they more of either the one or the other, it would destroy the proper ballance betwixt them, and I am satisfied moreover they would want occasions to put them to use.</p>
             
             <pb n="95" xml:id="pb-95" facs="#i101"/>
             <p>Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more luxuriant island, where you perceive the spring tide of our blood and humours runs high, - where we have more ambition, and pride, and envy, and lechery, and other whoreson passions upon our hands to govern and subject to reason, - the height of our wit and the depth of our judgment, you see, are exactly proportioned to the length and breadth of our necessities, - and accordingly, we have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to complain.</p>
             <p>It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air blows hot and cold, - wet and dry, the times in a day, we have them in no regular and settled way; - so that sometimes for near half a</p>
             
             <pb n="96" xml:id="pb-96" facs="#i102"/>
             <p>century together, there shall be very little wit or judgment, either to be seen or heard of amongst us: - the small channels of them shall seem quite dried up, - then all of a sudden the sluices shall break out, and take a fit of running again like fury, - you would think they would never stop: - and then it is, that in writing and fighting, and twenty other gallant things, we drive all the world before us.</p>
             <p>It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in that kind of argumentative process, which Suidas calls dialectick induction, - that I draw and set up this position as most true and veritable.</p>

For alas! could this effusion of light have been as easily procured, as the exordium wished it - I tremble to think how many thousands for it, of benighted travellers (in the learned sciences at least) must have groped and blundered on in the dark, all the nights of their lives, - running their heads against posts, and knocking out</p>

             <p>their brains without ever getting to their journies end; - some falling with their noses perpendicularly into stinks, - others horizontally with their tails into kennels. Here one half of a learned profession tilting full butt against the other half of it, and then tumbling and rolling one over the other in the dirt like hogs. - Here the brethren, of another profession, who should have run in opposition to each other, flying on the contrary like a flock of wild geese, all in a row the same way. - What confusion! - what mistakes! - fiddlers and painters judging by their eyes and ears, - admirable! - trusting to the passions excited in an air sung, or a story painted to the heart, - instead of measuring them by a quadrant.</p>
             <p>In the foreground of this picture, a statesman turning the political wheel, like</p>
             
             <pb n="99" xml:id="pb-99" facs="#i105"/>
             <p>a brute, the wrong way round - against the stream of corruption, - by heaven! - instead of with it.</p>
             <p>In this corner, a son of the divine Esculapius, writing a book against predestination; perhaps worse, - feeling his patient's pulse, instead of his apothecary's - a brother of the faculty in the back ground upon his knees in tears, - drawing the curtains of a mangled victim to beg his forgiveness; - offering a fee, - instead of taking one.</p>
             <p>In that spacious HALL, a coalition of the gown, from all the barrs of it, driving a damn'd, dirty, vexatious cause before them, with all their might and main, the wrong way; - kicking it out of the great doors, instead of, in, - and with such fury in their looks, and such a degree</p>

             <p>of inveteracy in their manner of kicking it, as if the laws had been originally made for the peace and preservation of mankind: - perhaps a more enormous mistake committed by them still, - a litigated point fairly hung up; - for instance, Whether John o'Nokes his nose, could stand in Tom o'Stiles his face, without a trespass, or not, - rashly determined by them in five and twenty minutes, which, with the cautious pro's and con's required in so intricate a proceeding, might have taken up as many months, - and if carried on upon a military plan, as your honours know, an ACTION should be, with all the stratagems practicable therein, - such as feints, - forced marches, - surprizes, - ambuscades, - mask-batteries, and a thousand other strokes of generalship which consist in catechising at all advantages on both sides, - might</p>

             <pb n="102" xml:id="pb-102" facs="#i108"/>
             <p>I say, reported to be, - for it is no more, my dear Sirs, than a report, and which like twenty others taken up every day upon trust, I maintain to be a vile and a malicious report into the bargain.</p>
             <p>This by the help of the observations already premised, and I hope already weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships, I shall forthwith make appear.</p>
             <p>I hate set dessertations, - and above all things in the world, 'tis one of the silliest things in one of them, to darken your hypothesis by placing a number of tall, opake words, one before another, in a right line, betwixt your own and your readers conception, - when in all likelihood, if you had looked about you,</p>
             
             <pb n="103" xml:id="pb-103" facs="#i109"/>
             <p>might have seen something standing, or hanging up, which would have cleared the point at once, - "for what hinderance, hurt or harm, doth the laudable desire of knowledge bring to any man, if even from a sot, a pot, a fool, a stool, a winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully, the lid of a goldsmith's crucible, an oyl bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair," - I am this moment sitting upon one. Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment, by the two knobs on the top of the back of it, - they are fasten'd on, you see, with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes, and will place what I have to say in so clear a light, as to let you see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface,  as plainly as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun beams.</p>
             
             <pb n="104" xml:id="pb-104" facs="#i110"/>
             <p>I enter now directly upon the point.</p>
             <p>- Here stands wit, - and there stands judgment, close beside it, just like the two knobbs I'm speaking of, upon the back of this self same chair on which I am sitting.</p>
             <p>- You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its frame, - as wit and judgment are of ours, - and like them too, indubitably both made and fitted to go together, in order as we say in all such cases of duplicated embellishments, - to answer one another.</p>
             <p>Now for the sake of an experiment, and for the clearer illustrating this matter, - let us for a moment, take off one of these two curious ornaments (I care not which) from the point or pinacle of the chair it</p>
             
             <pb n="105" xml:id="pb-105" facs="#i111"/>
             <p>now stands on; - nay, don't laugh at it. - But did you ever see in the whole course of your lives such a ridiculous business as this has made of it? - Why, 'tis a miserable a sight as a sow with one ear; and there is just as much sense and symmetry in the one, as in the other: - do, - pray, get off your seats, only to take a view of it. - Now would any man who valued his character a straw, have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such condition? - nay, lay your hands upon your hearts, and answer this plain question, Whether this one single knobb which now stands here like a  blockhead by itself, can serve any purpose upon earth, but to put one in mind of the want of the other; - and let me further ask, in case the chair was your own, if you would not in your consciences think, rather than be as it is, that</p>
             
             <pb n="106" xml:id="pb-106" facs="#i112"/>
             <p>it would be ten times better without any knobb at all.</p>
             <p>Now these two knobs - or top ornaments of the mind of man, which crown the whole entablature, - being, as I said, wit and judgment, which of all others, as I have proved it, are the most needful, - the most priz'd, - the most calamitous to be without, and consequently the hardest to come at, - for all these reasons put together, there is not a mortal amongst us, so destitute of a love of good fame or feeding, - or so ignorant of what will do him good therein, - who does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his own mind, to be, or to be thought at least master of the one or the other, and indeed of both of them, if the thing seems any way feasible, or likely to be brought to pass.</p>
             
             <pb n="107" xml:id="pb-107" facs="#i113"/>
             <p>Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in aiming at the one, - unless they laid hold of the other, - pray what do you think would become of them? - Why, Sirs, in spight of all their gravities, they must e'en have been contented to have gone with their insides naked: - this was not to be borne, but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the case we are upon, - so that no one could well have been angry with them, had they been satisfied with what little they could have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great perrywigs, had they not raised a hue and cry at the same time against the lawful owners.</p>
             <p>I need not tell your worships, that this was done with so much cunning and artifice, - that the great Locke, who was seldom</p>
             
             <pb n="108" xml:id="pb-108" facs="#i114"/>
             <p>outwitted by false sounds, - was nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it seems, was so deep and solemn a one, and what with the help of great wigs, grave faces, and other implements of deceit, was rendered so general a one against the poor wits in this matter, that the philosopher himself was deceived by it, - it was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand vulgar errors; - but this was not of the number; so that instead of sitting down cooly, as such a philosopher should have done, to have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised upon it; - on the contrary, he took the fact for granted, and so joined in with the cry, and halloo'd it as boisterously as the rest.</p>
             <p>This has been made the Magna Charta of stupidity ever since, - but your reverences</p>
             
             <pb n="109" xml:id="pb-109" facs="#i115"/>
             <p>plainly see, it has been obtained in such a manner, that the title to it is not worth a groat; - which by the bye is one of the many and vile impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for hereafter.</p>
             <p>As for great wigs, upon which I may be thought to have spoken my mind too freely, - I beg leave to qualify whatever has been unguardedly said to their dispraise or prejudice, by one general declaration - That I have no abhorrence whatever, nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or long beards, - any further than when I see they are bespoke and let grow on purpose to carry on this self-same imposture - for any purpose, - peace be with them; - <note>manicule</note> mark only, - I write not for them.</p>

             <p>EVERY day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have it mended - 'tis not mended yet; - no family but ours would have borne with it an hour, - and what is most astonishing, there was not a subject in the world upon which my father was so elegant, as upon that of door-hinges. - And yet at the same time, he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them, I think, that history can produce: his rhetoric and conduct were at perpetual handy-cuffs. - Never did the parlour-door open - but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to it; - three drops of oyl with a feather, and a smart stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour for ever.</p>

             <p>- Inconsistent soul that man is! - languishing under wounds, which he has the power to heal! - his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge! - his reason, that precious gift of God to him - (instead of pouring in oyl) serving but to sharpen his sensibilities, - to multiply his pains and render him more melancholy and uneasy under them! - poor unhappy creature, that he should do so! - are not the necessary causes of misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow; - struggle against evils which cannot be avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of the trouble they create him, would remove from his heart for ever.?</p>

             <p>of Shandy-Hall, - the parlour-door hinge shall be mended this reign.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXII.</p>
             <p>WHEN corporal Trim had brought his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying them directly into his parlour.</p>
             <p>Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of hinges, I had a speculative consideration arising out of it, and it is this.</p>
             <p>Had the parlour-door open'd and turn'd upon its hinges, as a door should do - </p>
             
             <pb n="113" xml:id="pb-113" facs="#i119"/>
             <p>- Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning upon its hinges, - (that is, in case things have all along gone well with your worship, - otherwise I give up my simile) - in this case, I say, there had been no danger either to master or man, in corporal Trim's peeping in: the moment, he had beheld my father and my uncle Toby fast asleep, - the respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent as death, and left them both in their armchairs, dreaming as happy as he had found them: but the thing was morally speaking so very impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to upon its account, - this was one; that he never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of being</p>
             
             <pb n="114" xml:id="pb-114" facs="#i120"/>
             <p>unavoidably awakened by the first person who should open the door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and so incessantly step'd in betwixt him and the first balmy presage of his repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the whole sweets of it.</p>
             <p>"When things move upon bad hinges, an' please your lordships, how can it be otherwise?</p>
             <p>Pray what's the matter? Who is there? cried my father, waking, the moment the door began to creak. - I wish the smith would give a peep at that confounded hinge. - 'Tis nothing, an' please your honour, said Trim, but two mortars I am bringing in. - They shan't make a clatter with them here, cried my father hastily. - If Dr. Slop has any</p>
             
             <pb n="115" xml:id="pb-115" facs="#i121"/>
             <p>drugs to pound, let him do it in the kitchen. - May it please your honour, cried Trim, - they are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer, which I have been making out of a pair of jack-boots, which Obadiah told me your honour had left off wearing. - By heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair, as he swore, - I have not one appointment belonging to me, which I set so much store by, as I do by these jack-boots, - they were our great-grandfather's, brother Toby, - they were hereditary. Then I fear, quoth my uncle Toby, Trim has cut off the entail. - I have only cut off the tops, an' please your honour, cried Trim. - I hate perpetuities as much as any man alive, cried my father, - but these jack-boots, continued he, (smiling, though very angry at the same time) have been in the family, brother,</p>
             
             <pb n="116" xml:id="pb-116" facs="#i122"/>
             <p>ever since the civil wars; - Sir Roger Shandy wore them at the battle of Marston-Moor. - I declare I would not have taken ten pounds for them. - I'll pay you the money, brother Shandy, quoth my uncle Toby, looking at the two mortars with infinite pleasure, and putting his hand into his breeches-pocket, as he viewed them. - I'll pay you the ten pounds this moment with all my heart and soul. -</p>
             <p>Brother Toby, replied my father, altering his tone, you care not what money you dissipate and throw away, provided, continued he, 'tis but upon a SIEGE. - Have I not a hundred and twenty pounds a year, besides my half-pay? cried my uncle Toby. - What is that, replied my father, hastily, - to ten pounds for a pair of jack-boots? - twelve guineas for your pontoons; - half as much for</p>
             
             <pb n="117" xml:id="pb-117" facs="#i123"/>
             <p>your Dutch-draw-bridge; - to say nothing of the train of little brass-artillery you bespoke last week, with twenty other preparations for the siege of Messina; believe me, dear brother Toby, continued my father, taking him kindly by the hand, - these military operations of yours are above your strength; - you mean well, brother, - but they carry you into greater expences than you were first aware of, - and take my word, - dear Toby, they will in the end quite ruin your fortune, and make a beggar of you. - What signifies it if they do, brother, replied my uncle Toby, so long as we know 'tis for the good of the nation. -</p>
             <p>My father could not help smiling for his soul; - his anger at the worst was never more than a spark, - and the zeal and simplicity of Trim, - and the generous</p>
             
             <pb n="118" xml:id="pb-118" facs="#i124"/>
             <p>(tho' hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle Toby, brought him into perfect good humour with them in an instant.</p>
             <p>Generous souls! - God prosper you both, and your mortar-pieces too, quoth my father to himself.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXIII.</p>
             <p>ALL is quiet and hush, cried my father, at least above stairs, - I hear not one foot stirring. - Prithee, Trim, who is in the kitchen? There is no one soul in the kitchen, answered Trim, making a low bow as he spoke, except Dr. Slop. - Confusion! cried my father, (getting up upon his legs a second time) - not one single thing has gone right this day! had I faith in astrology, brother, (which by the bye, my father had)</p>
             
             <pb n="119" xml:id="pb-119" facs="#i125"/>
             <p>I would have sworn some retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of mine, and turning every individual thing in it out of its place. - Why, I thought Dr. Slop had been above stairs with my wife, and so said you. - What can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen? - He is busy, an' please your honour, replied Trim, in making a bridge. - 'Tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle Toby; - pray give my humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell him I thank him heartily.</p>
             <p>You must know, my uncle Toby mistook the bridge as widely as my father mistook the mortars; - but to understand how my uncle Toby could mistake the bridge, - I fear I must give you an exact account of the road which led to it; - or to drop my metaphor, (for</p>
             
             <pb n="120" xml:id="pb-120" facs="#i126"/>
             <p>there is nothing more dishonest in an historian, than the use of one,) - in order to conceive the probability of this error in my uncle Toby aright, I must give you some account of an adventure of Trim's, though much against my will. I say much against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either amongst the anecdotes of my uncle Toby's amours with widow Wadman, in which corporal Trim was no mean actor, - or else in the middle of his and my uncle Toby's campaigns on the bowling green, - for it will do very well in either place; - but then if I reserve it for either of those parts of my story, - I ruin the story I'm upon, - and if I tell it here - I anticipate matters, and ruin it there.</p>
             
             <pb n="121" xml:id="pb-121" facs="#i127"/>
             <p>- What would your worships have me to do in this case?</p>
             <p>- Tell it, Mr. Shandy, by all means. - You are a fool, Tristram, if you do.</p>
             <p>O ye POWERS! (for powers ye are, and great ones too) - which enable mortal man to tell a story worth the hearing, - that kindly shew him, where he is to begin it, - and where he is to end it, - what he is to put into it, - and what he is to leave out, - how much of it he is to cast into shade, - and whereabouts he is to throw his light! - Ye, who preside over this vast empire of biographical free-booters, and see how many scrapes and plunges your subjects hourly fall into; - will you do one thing?</p>
             <p>I beg and beseech you, (in case you</p>
             
             <pb n="122" xml:id="pb-122" facs="#i128"/>
             <p>will do nothing better for us) that where-ever, in any part of your dominions it so falls out, that three several roads meet in one point, as they have done just here, - that at least you set up a guide-post, in the center of them, in mere charity to direct an uncertain devil, which of the three he is to take.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXIV.</p>
             <p>THO' the shock my uncle Toby received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk, in his affair with widow Wadman, had fixed him in a resolution, never more to think of the sex, - or of aught which belonged to it; - yet corporal Trim had made no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle Toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of circumstances which insensibly</p>
             
             <pb n="123" xml:id="pb-123" facs="#i129"/>
             <p>drew him in, to lay siege to that fair and strong citadel. - In Trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing in the world, but of him and Bridget in the kitchen; - though in truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle Toby employed his time and genius in tagging of points, - I am persuaded the honest corporal would laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle Toby sat down before the mistress, - corporal Trim incontinently took ground before the maid.</p>
             <p>Now, my dear friend Garrick, whom I have so much cause to esteem and honour, - (why, or wherefore, 'tis no matter) - can it escape your penetration, - I defy it, - that so many play-wrights, and</p>
             
             <pb n="124" xml:id="pb-124" facs="#i130"/>
             <p>opificers of chit chat have ever since been working upon Trim's and my uncle Toby's pattern. - I care not what Aristotle, or Pacuvius, or Bossu, or Ricaboni say, - (though I never read one of them) - there is not a greater difference between a single-horse chair and madam Pompadour's vis a vis, than betwixt a single armour, and an amour thus nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a grand drama. - Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind, - is quite lost in five acts, - but that is neither here or there.</p>
             <p>After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my uncle Toby's quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which shall be given in its proper place, my uncle Toby, honest man! found it necessary to draw off</p>
             
             <pb n="125" xml:id="pb-125" facs="#i131"/>
             <p>his forces, and raise the siege somewhat indignantly.</p>
             <p>Corporal Trim, as I said, had made no such bargain either with himself - or with any one else, - the fidelity however of his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with disgust, - he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a blockade; - that is, he kept others off, - for though he never after went to the house, yet he never met Bridget in the village, but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her, - or (as circumstances directed), he would shake her by the hand, - or ask her lovingly how she did, - or would give her a ribban, - and now and then,  though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give Bridget a -</p>

             <p>Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that is, from the demolition of Dunkirk in the year 13, to the latter end of my uncle Toby's campaign in the year 18, which was about six or seven weeks before the time I'm speaking of. - When Trim, as his custom was, after he had put my uncle Toby to bed, going down one moon-shiny night to see that every thing was right at his fortifications, - in the lane separated from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly, - he espied his Bridget.</p>
             <p>As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle Toby had made, Trim courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd trumpet of</p>
             
             <pb n="127" xml:id="pb-127" facs="#i133"/>
             <p>Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reached my father's, with this untoward circumstance along with it, that my uncle Toby's curious draw-bridge, constructed and painted after the Dutch fashion, and which went quite across the ditch, - was broke down, and some how or other crush'd all to pieces that very night.</p>
             <p>My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my uncle Toby's hobby-horse, - he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman mounted, and indeed unless my uncle Toby vexed him about it, could never think of it once, without smiling at it, - so that it never could get lame or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father's imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to his humour</p>
             
             <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i134"/>
               <p>than any one which had yet befall'n it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of entertainment to him. - Well, - but dear Toby! my father would say, do tell us seriously how this affair of the bridge happened. - How can you teaze me so much about it? my uncle Toby would reply, - I have told it you twenty times, word for word as Trim told it me. - Prithee, how was it then, corporal? my father would cry, turning to Trim. - It was a mere misfortune, an' please your honour, - I was shewing Mrs. Bridget our fortifications, and in going too near the edge of the fossÃ¨, I unfortunately slip'd in. - Very well Trim! my father would cry, - (smiling mysteriously, and giving a nod, - but without interrupting him) - and being link'd fast, an' please your honour, arm in arm with Mrs. Bridget, I dragg'd her after</p>
             
             <pb n="129" xml:id="pb-129" facs="#i135"/>
             <p>me, by means of which she fell backwards foss against the bridge, - and Trim's foot, (my uncle Toby would cry, taking the story out of his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the bridge too. - It was a thousand to one, my uncle Toby would add, that the poor fellow did not break his leg. - Ay truly! my father would say, - a limb is soon broke, brother Toby, in such encounters. - And so, an' please your honour, the bridge, which your honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us, and splintered all to pieces.</p>
             <p>At other times, but especially when my uncle Toby was so unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs or petards, - my father would exhaust all the stores of his eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a panegyric upon the</p>
             
             <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i136"/>
             <p>BATTERING-RAMS of the ancients, - the VINEA which Alexander made use of at the siege of Tyre. - He would tell my uncle Toby of the CATAPULTAE of the Syrians which threw such monstrous stones so many hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very foundation; - he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of the BALLISTA, which Marcellinus makes so much rout about, - the terrible effects of the PYRABOLI, - which cast fire, - the danger of the TEREBRA and SCORPIO, which cast javelins. - But what are these, he would say, to the destructive machinery of corporal Trim? - Believe me, brother Toby, no bridge, or bastion, or sally port that ever was constructed in this world, can hold out against such artillery.</p>
             <p>My uncle Toby would never attempt</p>

             <p>any defence against the force of this ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that it set my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit of violent coughing: my uncle Toby leap'd up without feeling the pain upon his groin, - and, with infinite pity, stood beside his brother's chair, tapping his back with one hand, and holding his head with the other, and from time to time, wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief, which he pull'd out of his pocket. - The affectionate and endearing manner in which my uncle Toby did these little offices, - cut my father thro' his reins, for the pain he had just been giving him. - May my brains be knock'd out with a battering ram or a catapulta, I care not which,</p>
             
             <pb n="132" xml:id="pb-132" facs="#i138"/>
             <p>quoth my father to himself, - if ever I insult this worthy soul more.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXV.</p>
             <p>THE draw-bridge being held irreparable, Trim was ordered directly to set about another, - but not upon the same model; for cardinal Alberoni's intrigues at that time being discovered, and my uncle Toby rightly foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt Spain and the Empire, and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be either in Naples or Scicily, - he determined upon an Italian bridge, - (my uncle Toby, by the bye, was not far out in his conjectures) - but my father, who was infinitely the better politician, and took the lead as far of my uncle Toby in the cabinet, as my</p>
             
             <pb n="133" xml:id="pb-133" facs="#i139"/>
             <p>uncle Toby took it of him in the field, - convinced him, that if the King of Spain and the Emperor went together by the ears, that England and France and Holland must, by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the lists too; - and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother Toby, as sure as we are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old prize-fighting stage of Flanders; - then what will you do with your Italian bridge?</p>
             <p>- We will go on with it then, upon the old model, cried my uncle Toby.</p>
             <p>When corporal Trim had about half finished it in that stile, - my uncle Toby found out a capital defect in it, which he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned, it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle, one</p>
             
             <pb n="134" xml:id="pb-134" facs="#i140"/>
               <p>half of which turning to one side of the fossÃ¨, and the other, to the other; the advantage of which was this, that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it impowered my uncle Toby to raise it up or let it down with the end of his crutch, and with one hand, which, as his garrison was weak, was as much as he could well spare, - but the disadvantages of such a construction were insurmountable, - for by this means, he would say, I leave one half of my bridge in my enemy's possession, - and pray of what use is the other?</p>
             <p>The natural remedy for this, was no doubt to have his bridge fast only at one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted up together, and stand bolt upright, - but that was rejected for the reason given above.</p>
             
             <pb n="135" xml:id="pb-135" facs="#i141"/>
             <p>For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of that particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally, to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to gain a passage, - of which sorts your worships might have seen three famous ones at Spires before its destruction, - and one now at Brisac, if I mistake not; - but my father advising my uncle Toby, with great earnestness, to have nothing more to do with thrusting bridges, - and my uncle foreseeing moreover that it would but perpetuate the memory of the corporal's misfortune, - he changed his mind, for that of the marquis d'HÃ´pital's invention, which the younger Bernouilli has so well and learnedly described, as your worships may see, - Act. Erud. Lips. an. 1695, - to these a lead weight is an eternal ballance, and keeps watch as well as a</p>
             
             <pb n="136" xml:id="pb-136" facs="#i142"/>
             <p>couple of centinels, inasmuch as the construction of them was a curve-line approximating to a cycloid, - if not a cycloid itself.</p>
             <p>My uncle Toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man in England, - but was not quite such a master of the cycloid; - he talked however about it every day; - the bridge went not forwards. - We'll ask somebody about it, cried my uncle Toby to Trim.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXVI.</p>
             <p>WHEN Trim came in and told my father, that Dr. Slop was in the kitchen, and busy in making a bridge, - my uncle Toby, - the affair of the jack-boots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain, - took it instantly</p>
             
             <pb n="137" xml:id="pb-137" facs="#i143"/>
             <p>for granted that Dr. Slop was making a model of the marquis d'HÃ´pital's bridge. - 'Tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle Toby; - pray give my humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell him I thank him heartily. </p>
             <p>Had my uncle Toby's head been a savoyard's box, and my father peeping in all the time at one end of it, - it could not have given him a more distinct conception of the operations in my uncle Toby's imagination, than what he had; so notwithstanding the catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter imprecation about them, he was just beginning to triumph. -</p>
             <p>When Trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and twisted it to pieces.</p>

             <p>CHAP. XXVII.</p>
             <p>- THIS unfortunate draw-bridge of yours, quoth my father - God bless your honour, cried Trim, 'tis a bridge for master's nose. - In bringing him into the world with his vile instruments, he has crush'd his nose, Susannah says, as flat as a pancake to his face, and he is making a false bridge with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of Susannah's stays, to raise it up.</p>
             <p>- Lead me, brothet Toby, cried my father, to my room this instant.</p>
             
             <pb n="139" xml:id="pb-139" facs="#i145"/>
             <p>CHAP. XXVIII.</p>
             <p>FROM the first moment I sat down to write my life for the amusement of the world, and my opinions for its instruction, has a cloud insensibly been gathering over my father. - A tide of little evils and distresses has been setting in against him. - Not one thing, as he observed himself, has gone right: and now is the storm thicken'd, and going to break, and pour down full upon his head.</p>
             <p>I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and melancholy frame of mind, that ever sympathetic breast was touched with. - My nerves relax as I tell it. - Every line I write, I feel an abatement of the quickness of</p>
             
             <pb n="140" xml:id="pb-140" facs="#i146"/>
             <p>my pulse, and of that careless alacrity with it, which every day of my life prompts me to say and write a thousand things I should not. - And this moment that I last dipp'd my pen into my ink, I could not help taking notice what a cautious air of sad composure and solemnity there appear'd in my manner of doing it. - Lord! how different from the rash jerks, and hare-brain'd squirts thou art wont, Tristram! to transact it with in other humours, - dropping thy pen, - spurting thy ink about thy table and thy books, - as if thy pen and thy ink, thy books and thy furniture cost thee nothing.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXIX.</p>
             <p>- I WON'T go about to argue the point with you, - 'tis so, - and</p>
             
             <pb n="141" xml:id="pb-141" facs="#i147"/>
             <p>I am persuaded of it, madam, as much as can be, "That both man and woman bear pain or sorrow, (and, for aught I know, pleasure too) best in a horizontal position."</p>
             <p>The moment my father got up into his chamber, he threw himself prostrate across his bed in the wildest disorder imaginable, but at the same time, in the most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows, that ever the eye of pity dropp'd a tear for. - The palm of his right hand, as he fell upon the bed, receiving his forehead, and covering the greatest part of both his eyes, gently sunk down with his head (his elbow giving way backwards) till his nose touch'd the quilt; - his left arm hung insensible over the side of the bed, his knuckles reclining upon the handle of the chamber</p>
             
             <pb n="142" xml:id="pb-142" facs="#i148"/>
             <p>pot, which peep'd out beyond the valance, - his right leg (his left being drawn up towards his body) hung half over the side of the bed, the edge of it pressing upon his shin-bone. - He felt it not. A fix'd, inflexible sorrow took possession of every line of his face. - He sigh'd once, - heaved his breast often, - but utter'd not a word.</p>
             <p>An old set-stitch'd chair, valanced and fringed around with party-colour'd worsted bobs, stood at the bed's head, opposite to the side where my father's head reclined. - My uncle Toby sat him down in it.</p>
             <p>Before an affliction is digested, - consolation ever comes too soon; - and after it is digested, - it comes too late: so that you see, madam, there is but a</p>
             
             <pb n="143" xml:id="pb-143" facs="#i149"/>
             <p>mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a comforter to take aim at: my uncle Toby was always either on this side, or on that of it, and would often say, He believed in his heart, he could as soon hit the longitude; for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew the curtain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one's service, - he pull'd out a cambrick handkerchief, - gave a low sigh, - but held his peace.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXX.</p>
             <p>- "ALL is not gain that is got into the purse." - So that notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the oddest books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the oddest way of thinking, that ever</p>
             
             <pb n="144" xml:id="pb-144" facs="#i150"/>
             <p>man in it was bless'd with, yet it had this drawback upon him after all, - that it laid him open to some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses; of which this particular one which he sunk under at present is as strong an example as can be given.</p>
             <p>No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child's nose, by the edge of a pair of forceps, - however scientifically applied, - would vex any man in the world, who was at so much pains in begetting a child, as my father was, - yet it will not account for the extravagance of his affliction, or will it justify the unchristian manner he abandoned and surrender'd himself up to.</p>
             <p>To explain this, I must leave him upon</p>
             
             <pb n="145" xml:id="pb-145" facs="#i151"/>
             <p>the bed for half an hour, - and my good uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXXI.</p>
             <p>- I THINK it a very unreasonable demand, - cried my great grandfather, twisting up the paper, and throwing it upon the table. - By this account, madam, you have but two thousand pounds fortune, and not a shilling more, - and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year jointure for it. -</p>
             <p>- "Because" replied my great grandmother, "you have little or no nose, "Sir." -</p>
             <p>Now, before I venture to make use</p>
             
             <pb n="146" xml:id="pb-146" facs="#i152"/>
             <p>of the word Nose a second time, - to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon it, in this interesting part of my story, it may not be amiss to explain my own meaning, and define, with all possible exactness and precision, what I would willingly be understood to mean by the term: being of opinion, that 'tis owing to the negligence and perverseness of writers, in despising this precaution, and to nothing else, - That all the polemical writings in divinity, are not as clear and demonstrative as those upon a Will o' the Wisp, or any other sound part of philosophy, and natural pursuit; in order to which, what have you to do, before you set out, unless you intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgment, - but to give the world a good definition, and stand to it, of the main word you have most occasion for, - changing it, Sir, as</p>
             
             <pb n="147" xml:id="pb-147" facs="#i153"/>
             <p>you would a guinea, into small coin? - which done, - let the father of confusion puzzle you, if he can; or put a different idea either into your head, or your reader's head, if he knows how.</p>
             <p>In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as this I am engaged in, - the neglect is inexcusable; and heaven is witness, how the world has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many openings to equivocal strictures, - and for depending so much as I have done, all along, upon the cleanliness of my reader's imaginations.</p>
             <p>- Here are two senses, cried Eugenius, as we walk'd along, pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the word Crevice, in the fifty-second page of the second volume of this book of books,</p>
             
             <pb n="148" xml:id="pb-148" facs="#i154"/>
             <p>- here are two senses, - quoth he. - And here are two roads, replied I, turning short upon him, - a dirty and a clean one, - which shall we take? - The clean, - by all means, replied Eugenius. Eugenius, said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his breast, - to define - is to distrust. - Thus I triumph'd over Eugenius; but I triumph'd over him as I always do, like a fool. - 'Tis my comfort however, I am not an obstinate one; therefore</p>
             <p>I define a nose, as follows, - intreating only beforehand, and beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age, complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own souls, to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other ideas</p>
             
             <pb n="149" xml:id="pb-149" facs="#i155"/>
             <p>into their minds, than what I put into my definition. - For by the word Nose, throughout all this long chapter of noses, and in every other part of my work, where the word Nose occurs, - I declare, by that word I mean a Nose, and nothing more, or less.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXXII.</p>
             <p>- "BECAUSE," quoth my grandmother, repeating the words again, - "you have little or no nose, Sir" -</p>
             <p>S'death! cried my great grandfather, clapping his hand upon his nose, - 'tis not so small as that comes to; - 'tis a full inch longer than my father's. - Now, my great grandfather's nose was for all</p>
             
             <pb n="150" xml:id="pb-150" facs="#i156"/>
             <p>the world like unto the noses of all the men, women, and children, whom Pantagruel found dwelling upon the island of ENNASIN. - By the way, if you would know the strange way of getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a people, - you must read the book; - find it out yourself, you never can. -</p>
             <p>- 'Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs.</p>
             <p>- 'Tis a full inch, continued my great grandfather, pressing up the ridge of his nose with his finger and thumb; and repeating his assertion, - 'tis a full inch longer, madam, than my father's - . You must mean your uncle's, replied my great grandmother.</p>
             
             <pb n="151" xml:id="pb-151" facs="#i157"/>
             <p>- My great grandfather was convinced. - He untwisted the paper, and signed the article.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXXIII.</p>
             <p>- WHAT an unconscionable jointure, my dear, do we pay out of this small estate of ours, quoth my grandmother to my grandfather.</p>
             <p>My father, replied my grandfather, had no more nose, my dear, saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my hand. -</p>
             <p>- Now, you must know, that my great grandmother outlived my grandfather twelve years; so that my father</p>
             
             <pb n="152" xml:id="pb-152" facs="#i158"/>
             <p>had the jointure to pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly - (on Michaelmas and Lady day) - during all that time.</p>
             <p>No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father. - And as far as the hundred pounds went, he would fling it upon the table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome, which generous souls, and generous souls only, are able to fling down money: but as soon as ever he enter'd upon the odd fifty, - he generally gave a loud Hem! - rubb'd the side of his nose leisurely with the flat part of his fore finger, - inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his wig, - look'd at both sides of every guinea, as he parted with it, - and seldom</p>
             
             <pb n="153" xml:id="pb-153" facs="#i159"/>
             <p>could get to the end of the fifty pounds, without pulling out his handkerchief, and wiping his temples.</p>
             <p>Defend me, gracious heaven! from those persecuting spirits who make no allowances for these workings within us. - Never, - O never may I lay down in their tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors!</p>
             <p>For three generations at least, this tenet in favour of long noses had gradually been taking root in our family. - TRADITION was all along on its side, and INTEREST was every half year stepping in to strengthen it; so that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from</p>
             
             <pb n="154" xml:id="pb-154" facs="#i160"/>
             <p>having the whole honour of this, as it had of almost all his other strange notions. - For in a great measure he might be said to have suck'd this in, with his mother's milk. He did his part however. - If education planted the mistake, (in case it was one) my father watered it, and ripened it to perfection.</p>
             <p>He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in England could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses. - And for the contrary reason, he would generally add, That it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line, did not raise and hoist it</p>

             <p>- Fair and softly, gentle reader! - where is thy fancy carrying thee? - If there is truth in man, by my great grandfather's nose, I mean the external organ of smelling, or that part of man which stands prominent in his face,</p>

             <p>CHAP. XXXIV.</p>
             <p>IT is a singular blessing, that nature has form'd the mind of man with the same happy backwardness and renitency against conviction, which is observed in old dogs, - "of not learning new tricks."</p>
             <p>What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher that ever existed, be whisk'd into at once, did he read</p>
             
             <pb n="157" xml:id="pb-157" facs="#i163"/>
             <p>such books, and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as would eternally be making him change sides!</p>
             <p>Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all this. - He pick'd up an opinion, Sir, as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple. - It becomes his own, - and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than give it up. -</p>
             <p>I am aware, that Didius the great civilian, will contest this point; and cry out against me, Whence comes this man's right to this apple? ex confesso, he will say, - things were in a state of nature. - The apple, as much Frank's apple, as John's. Pray, Mr. Shandy, what patent has he to shew for it? and how did it begin to be his? was it, when he set</p>
             
             <pb n="158" xml:id="pb-158" facs="#i164"/>
             <p>his heart upon it? or when he gather'd it? or when he chew'd it? or when he roasted it? or when he peel'd? or when he brought it home? or when he digested? - or when he - ? - . For 'tis plain, Sir, if the first picking up of the apple, made it not his, - that no subsequent act could.</p>
             <p>Brother Didius, Tribonius will answer, - (now Tribonius the civilian and church lawyer's beard being three inches and a half and three eighths longer than Didius his beard, - I'm glad he takes up the cudgels for me, so I give myself no further trouble about the answer.) - Brother Didius, Tribonius will say, it is a decreed case, as you may find it in the fragments of Gregorius and Hermogenes's codes, and in all the codes from Justinian's down to</p>
             
             <pb n="159" xml:id="pb-159" facs="#i165"/>
             <p>the codes of Louis and Des Eaux, - That the sweat of a man's brows, and the exsudations of a man's brains, are as much a man's own property, as the breeches upon his backside; - which said exsudations, &amp;c. being dropp'd upon the said apple by the labour of finding it, and picking it up; and being moreover indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex'd by the picker up, to the thing pick'd up, carried home, roasted, peel'd, eaten, digested, and so on; - 'tis evident that the gatherer of the apple, in so doing, has mix'd up something which was his own, with the apple which was not his own, by which means he has acquired a property; - or, in other words, the apple is John's apple.</p>
             <p>By the same learned chain of reasoning</p>
             
             <pb n="160" xml:id="pb-160" facs="#i166"/>
             <p>my father stood up for all his opinions; he had spared no pains in picking them up, and the more they lay out of the common way, the better still was his title. - No mortal claim'd them; they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above, so that they might well and truely be said to be his own goods and chattles. - Accordingly he held fast by 'em, both by teeth and claws, - would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on, - and in a word, would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breast-works, as my uncle Toby would a citadel.</p>
             <p>There was one plaguy rub in the way of this, - the scarcity of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in case</p>

What was to be had, however, he set the greater store by; and though my father would oft-times sport with my uncle Toby's library, - which, by the bye, was ridiculous enough, - yet at the very same time he did it, he collected every book</p>

             <p>Whilst I am worth one, to pay a weeder, - thy path from thy door to thy bowling green shall never be grown up. - Whilst there is a rood and a half of land in the Shandy family, thy fortifications, my dear uncle Toby, shall never be demolish'd.</p>

             <p>MY father's collection was not great, but to make amends, it was curious; and consequently, he was some time in making it; he had the great good fortune however to set off well, in getting Bruscambille's prologue upon long noses, almost for nothing, - for he gave no more for Bruscambille than three half crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it. - There are not three Bruscumbilles in Christendom, - said the stall-man, except what are chain'd up in the libraries of the curious. My father flung down the money as quick as lightening, - took Bruscambille into his bosom, - hyed home</p>

             <p>from Piccadilly to Coleman-street with it, as he would have hyed home with a treasure, without taking his hand once off from Bruscambille all the way.</p>
             <p>To those who do not yet know of which gender Bruscambille is, - inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily be done by either, - 'twill be no objection against the simile, - to say, That when my father got home, he solaced himself with Bruscambille after the manner, in which, 'tis ten to one, your worship solaced yourself with your first mistress, - that is, from morning even unto night: which by the bye, how delightful soever it may prove to the inamorato, - is of little, or no entertainment at all, to by-standers. - Take notice, I go no farther with the simile. - my father's eye was greater than his</p>

             <p>CHAP. XXXVI.</p>
             <p>OF all the tracts my father was at the pains to procure and study in support of his hypothesis, there was not any one wherein he felt a more cruel disappointment at first, than in the celebrated dialogue between Pamphagus and Cocles, written by the chaste pen of the great and venerable Erasmus, upon the various uses</p>
             
             <pb n="167" xml:id="pb-167" facs="#i173"/>
             <p>and seasonable applications of long noses. - Now don't let Satan, my dear girl, in this chapter, take advantage of any one spot of rising-ground to get astride of your imagination, if you can any ways help it; or if he is so nimble as to slip on, - let me beg of you, like an unback'd filly, to frisk it, to squirt it, to jump it, to rear it, to bound it, - and to kick it, with long kicks and short kicks, till like Tickletoby's mare, you break a strap or a crupper, and throw his worship into the dirt. - You need not kill him. -</p>
             <p>- And pray who was Tickletoby's mare? - 'tis just as discreditable and unscholar-like a question, Sir, as to have asked what year (ab urb. con.) the second Punic war broke out. - Who was Tickletoby's</p>
             
             <pb n="168" xml:id="pb-168" facs="#i174"/>
             <p>mare! - Read, read, read, read, my unlearned reader! read, - or by the knowledge of the great saint Paraleipomenon - I tell you before-hand, you had better throw down the book at once; for without much reading, by which your reverence knows, I mean much knowledge, you will no more be able to penetrate the moral of the next marbled page (motly emblem of my work!) than the world with all its sagacity has been able to unraval the many opinions, transactions and truths which still lie mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one.</p>

             <p>"NIHIL me poenitet hujus nasi," quoth Pamphagus; - that is, - "My nose has been the making of me.' - "Nec est cur poeniteat," replies Cocles; that is, "How the duce should such a nose fail?"</p>
             <p>The doctrine, you see, was laid down by Erasmus, as my father wished it, with the utmost plainness; but my father's disappointment was, in finding nothing more from so able a pen, but the bare fact itself; without any of that speculative subtilty or ambidexterity of argumentation upon it, which heaven had bestow'd upon man on purpose to investigate truth and fight for her on all sides. - My father pish'd and pugh'd at first most terribly, - 'tis worth something to have a good name. As the dialogue was of Erasmus, my father soon came to himself, and read</p>
             
             <pb n="172" xml:id="pb-172" facs="#i178"/>
             <p>it over and over again with great application, studying every word and every syllable of it thro' and thro' in its most strict and literal interpretation, - he could still make nothing of it, that way. Mayhaps there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my father. - Learned men, brother Toby, don't write dialogues upon long noses for nothing. - I'll study the mystic and the allegoric sense, - here is some room to turn a man's self in, brother.</p>
             <p>My father read on. -</p>
             <p>Now, I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships, that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by Erasmus, the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic conveniences also, for that in a case of distress, - and for want of a pair of bellows, it will do excellently well, ad excitandum focum, (to stir up the fire.)</p>

             <p>Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure, and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him, as she had done the seeds of all other knowledge, - so that he had got out his penknife, and was trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not scratch some better sense into it. - I've got within a single letter, brother Toby, cried my father, of Erasmus his mystic meaning. - You are near enough, brother, replied my uncle, in all conscience. - Pshaw! cried my father, scratching on, - I might as well be seven miles off. - I've done it, - said my father, snapping his fingers. - See, my dear brother Toby, how I have mended the sense. - But you have marr'd a word, replied my uncle Toby. - My father put on his spectacles, - bit his lip, - and tore out the leaf in a passion.</p>

             <p>CHAP. XXXVIII.</p>
             <p>O Slawkenbergius! thou faithful analyzer of my DisgrÃ¡zias, - thou sad foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns, which in one stage or other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose, and no other cause, that I am conscious of. - Tell me, Slawkenbergius! what secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it sound in thy ears? - art thou sure thou heard'st it? - which first cried out to thee, - go, - go, Slawkenbergius! dedicate the labours of thy life, - neglect thy pastimes, - call forth all the powers and faculties of thy nature, - macerate thyself in the service of mankind, and write a grand FOLIO for them, upon the subject of their noses.</p>
             
             <pb n="175" xml:id="pb-175" facs="#i181"/>
             <p>How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergius's sensorium, - so that Slawkenbergius should know whose finger touch'd the key, - and whose hand it was that blew the bellows, - as Hafen Slawkenbergius has been dead and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten years, - we can only raise conjectures.</p>
             <p>Slawkenbergius was play'd upon, for aught I know, like one of Whitfield's disciples, - that is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the two masters it was, that had been practising upon his instrument, - as to make all reasoning upon it needless.</p>
             <p>- For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his motives and occasions for writing, and spending so many years of his life upon</p>
             
             <pb n="176" xml:id="pb-176" facs="#i182"/>
             <p>this one work. - Towards the end of his prologomena, which by the bye should have come first, - but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the analitical contents of the book, and the book itself, - he informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down coolly, and consider within himself the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of his being; - or, - to shorten my translation, for Slawkenbergius's book is in Latin, and not a little prolix in this passage, - ever since I understood, quoth Slawkenbergius, any thing, - or rather what was what, - and could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by all who had gone before; - have I, Slawkenbergius, felt a strong impulse, with a mighty and an unresistible</p>
             
             <pb n="177" xml:id="pb-177" facs="#i183"/>
             <p>call within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.</p>
             <p>And to do justice to Slawkenbergius, he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it, than any one man who had ever entered it before him, - and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be en-nich'd as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by, - for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject, - examined every part of it, dialectially, - then brought it into full day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike, - or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it, - collating, collecting and compiling, - begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had</p>
             
             <pb n="178" xml:id="pb-178" facs="#i184"/>
             <p>been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered, not only as a model, - but as a thorough-stitch'd DIGEST and regular institute of noses; comprehending in it, all that is, or can be needful to be known about them.</p>
             <p>For this cause it is, that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father's collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses, - or collaterally touching them; - such for instance as Prignitz, now lying upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of twenty charnel houses in Silesia, which he had rummaged, - has informed us, that</p>
             
             <pb n="179" xml:id="pb-179" facs="#i185"/>
             <p>the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or boney parts of human noses, in any given tract of country, except Crim Tartary, where they are all crush'd down by the thumb, so that no judgment can be formed upon them, - are much nearer alike, than the world imagines; - the difference amongst them, being, he says, a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of, - but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is owing to the cartilagenous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell'd, and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but a step from it, (bating the case of ideots, whom Prignitz, who had lived many years in Turky, supposes under the more immediate tutelage of heaven) - it so</p>
             
             <pb n="180" xml:id="pb-180" facs="#i186"/>
             <p>happens, and ever must, says Prignitz, that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer's fancy.</p>
             <p>It is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all comprehended in Slawkenbergius, that I say nothing likewise of Scroderus (Andrea) who all the world knows, set himself to oppugn Prignitz with great violence, - proving it in his own way, first, logically and then by a series of stubborn facts, "That so far was Prignitz from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary, - the nose begat the fancy."</p>
             <p>- The learned suspected Scroderus, of an indecent sophism in this, - and Prignitz cried out aloud in the dispute, that Scroderus had shifted the idea upon him,</p>
             
             <pb n="181" xml:id="pb-181" facs="#i187"/>
             <p>- But Scroderus went on, maintaining his thesis. -</p>
             <p>My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he should take in this affair; when Ambrose Paraeus decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both of Prignitz and Scroderus, drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once.</p>
             <p>Be witness -</p>
             <p>I don't acquaint the learned reader, - in saying it, I mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact myself. -</p>
             <p>That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose-mender to Francis the ninth of France, and in high credit with him and the two preceding, or succeeding</p>
             
             <pb n="182" xml:id="pb-182" facs="#i188"/>
             <p>kings (I know not which) - and that except in the slip he made in his story of Taliacotius's noses, and his manner of setting them on, - was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.</p>
             <p>Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world, and upon which Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much learning and fine parts, - was neither this nor that, - but that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast, - as the flatness and shortness of puisne noses was, to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition</p>
             
             <pb n="183" xml:id="pb-183" facs="#i189"/>
             <p>in the hale and lively, - which, tho' happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child, inasmuch as his nose was so snubb'd, so rebuff'd, so rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive ad mensuram suam legitimam; - but that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother's breast, - by sinking into it, quoth Paraeus, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.</p>
             <p>I have but two things to observe of Paraeus; first, that he proved and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression: - for which may his soul for ever rest in peace!</p>
             <p>And, secondly, that besides the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus, which Ambrose</p>
             
             <pb n="184" xml:id="pb-184" facs="#i190"/>
             <p>Paraeus his hypothesis effectually overthrew, - it overthrew at the same time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for three days together, not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but turn'd likewise the whole house and every thing in it, except my uncle Toby, quite upside down.</p>
             <p>Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife, never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of a street door.</p>
             <p>My mother, you must know, - but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first, - I have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand distresses and domestic misadventures crouding in upon me</p>

             <p>thick and three-fold, one upon the neck of another, - a cow broke in (tomorrow morning) to my uncle Toby's fortifications, and eat up two ratios and half of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced his horn-work and covered way. - Trim insists upon being tried by a court-martial, - the cow to be shot, - Slop to be crucifix'd, - myself to be tristram'd, and at my very baptism made a martyr of; - poor unhappy devils that we all are! - I want swaddling, - but there is no time to be lost in exclamations. - I have left my father lying across his bed, and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair, sitting beside him, and promised I would go back to them in half an hour, and five and thirty minutes are laps'd already. - Of all the perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in, - this certainly is the greatest,</p>

             <p>- for I have Hafen Slawkenbergius's folio, Sir, to finish - a dialogue between my father and my uncle Toby, upon the solution of Prignitz, Scroderus, Ambrose Paraeus, Ponocrates and Grangousier to relate, - a tale out of Slawkenbergius to translate, and all this in five minutes less, than no time at all; - such a head! - would to heaven! my enemies only saw the inside of it!</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXXIX.</p>
             <p>THERE was not any one scene more entertaining in our family, - and to do it justice in this point; - and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration to the world concerning this one article, the more solemn, - that I believe in my soul, (unless</p>

             <p>my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things, never made or put a family together, (in that period at least of it, which I have sat down to write the story of) - where the characters of it were cast or contrasted with so dramatic a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the SHANDY-FAMILY.</p>
             <p>Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this whimsical theatre of ours, - than what frequently arose out of this self-same chapter of long noses, - especially when my father's imagination was heated with the enquiry, and nothing</p>

             <p>would serve him but to heat my uncle Toby's too.</p>
             <p>My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoaking his pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and Scroderus's solutions into it.</p>
             <p>Whether they were above my uncle Toby's reason, - or contrary to it, - or that his brain was like wet tinder, and no spark could possibly take hold, - or that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into Prignitz and Scroderus's doctrines, - I say not, let school men - scullions, anatomists, and</p>

             <p>engineers, fight for it amongst themselves. -</p>
             <p>'Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle Toby, and render out of Slawkenbergius's Latin, of which, as he was no great master, his translation was not always of the purest, - and generally least so where 'twas most wanted, - this naturally open'd a door to a second misfortune; - that in the warmer paroxisms of his zeal to open my uncle Toby's eyes - my father's ideas run on, as much faster than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle Toby's; - neither the one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father's lecture.</p>

             <p>CHAP. XL.</p>
             <p>THE gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms, - I mean in man, - for in superior classes of beings, such as angels and spirits, - 'tis all done, may it please your worships, as they tell me, by INTUITION; - and beings inferior, as your worships all know, - syllogize by their noses: though there is an island swiming in the sea, though not altogether at its ease, whose inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion, and oft-times to make very well out too: - but that's neither here nor there -</p>
             <p>The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, - or the great and principal</p>
             
             <pb n="191" xml:id="pb-191" facs="#i197"/>
             <p>act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another, by the intervention of a third; (called the medius terminus) just as a man, as Locke well observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same length, which could not be brought together, to measure their equality, by juxta-position.</p>
             <p>Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his systems of noses, and observed my uncle Toby's deportment, - what great attention he gave to every word, - and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of it, - surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb, - then foreright, - then this way, and</p>
             
             <pb n="192" xml:id="pb-192" facs="#i198"/>
             <p>then that, in all its possible directions and foreshortenings, - he would have concluded my uncle Toby had got hold of the medius terminus; and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of long noses, in order as my father laid them before him. This by the bye, was more than my father wanted, - his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophic lectures, - was to enable my uncle Toby not to discuss, - but comprehend - to hold the grains and scruples of learning, - not to weigh them. - My uncle Toby, as you will read in the next chapter, did neither the one or the other.</p>

             <p>CHAP. XLI.</p>
             <p>'TIS a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three hours painful translation of Slawkenbergius, - 'tis a pity, cried my father, putting my mother's thread-paper into the book for a mark, as he spoke - that truth, brother Toby, should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnessess, and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest siege. -</p>
             <p>Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my uncle Toby's fancy, during the time of my father's explanation of Prignitz to him, - having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short flight to the bowling-green; - his body might as well have taken a turn there</p>
             
             <pb n="194" xml:id="pb-194" facs="#i200"/>
             <p>too, - so that with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon <note>'upon' has been misprinted</note> the medius terminus, - my uncle Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its pro's and con's, as if my father had been translating Hafen Slawkenbergius from the Latin tongue into the CherokeÃ¨. But the word siege, like a talismanic power, in my father's metaphor, wafting back my uncle Toby's fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch, - he open'd his ears, - and my father observing that he took his pipe out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a desire to profit, - my father with great pleasure began his sentence again, - changing only the plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it.</p>
             
             <pb n="195" xml:id="pb-195" facs="#i201"/>
             <p>'Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one side, brother Toby, - considering what ingenuity these learned men have all shewn in their solutions of noses. - Can noses be dissolved? replied my uncle Toby. -</p>
             <p>- My father thrust back his chair, - rose up, - put on his hat, - took four long strides to the door, - jerked it open, - thrust his head half way out, - shut the door again, - took no notice of the bad hinge, - returned to the table, - pluck'd my mother's thread-paper out of Slawkenbergius's book, - went hastily to his bureau, - walk'd slowly back, twisting my mother's thread-paper about his thumb, - unbutton'd his waistcoat, - threw my mother's thread-paper into the fire, - but her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill'd his mouth with bran, - confounded it; - but mark! - the oath of confusion</p>
             
             <pb n="196" xml:id="pb-196" facs="#i202"/>
             <p>was levell'd at my uncle Toby's brain, - which was e'en confused enough already, - the curse came charged only with the bran, - the bran, may it please your honours, - was no more than powder to the ball.</p>
             <p>'Twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on't, and it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle Toby's questions. - Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many different places all at one time, - he could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds, - or started half so</p>
             
             <pb n="197" xml:id="pb-197" facs="#i203"/>
             <p>much, as with one single quaere of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his hobbyhorsical career.</p>
             <p>'Twas all one to my uncle Toby, - he smoaked his pipe on, with unvaried composure, - his heart never intended offence to his brother, - and as his head could seldom find out where the sting of it lay, - he always gave my father the credit of cooling by himself. - He was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present case.</p>
             <p>By all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and taking the oath out of Ernulphus's digest of curses, - (though to do my father justice it was a fault (as he told Dr. Slop in the affair of Ernulphus) which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth.) - By all that's good and great! brother</p>

             <p>Toby, said my father, if it was not for the aids of philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do, - you would put a man beside all temper. - Why, by the solutions of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant as you might have known, had you favoured me with one grain of attention, the various accounts which learned men of different kinds of knowledge have given the world, of the causes of short and long noses. - There is no cause but one, replied my uncle Toby, - why one man's nose is longer than another's, but because that God pleases to have it so. - That is Grangousier's solution, said my father. - 'Tis he, continued my uncle Toby, looking up, and not regarding my father's interruption, who makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his infinite wisdom. - 'Tis a pious account, cried</p>
             
             <pb n="199" xml:id="pb-199" facs="#i205"/>
             <p>my father, but not philosophical, - there is more religion in it than sound science. 'Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle Toby's character, - that he feared God, and reverenced religion. - So the moment my father finished his remark, - my uncle Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero, with more zeal (though more out of tune) than usual. -</p>
             <p>What is become of my wife's thread-paper?</p>
             <p>CHAP. XLII.</p>
             <p>NO matter, - as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of some consequence to my mother, - of none to my father, as a mark in Slawkenbergius. Slawkenbergius in every page of him was a rich treasury of inexhaustible knowledge to my father, - he could not</p>
             
             <pb n="200" xml:id="pb-200" facs="#i206"/>
             <p>open him amiss; and he would often say in closing the book, that if all the arts and sciences in the world, with the books which treated of them, were lost, - should the wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through disuse, ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had wrote, or caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak sides of courts and kingdoms, should they be forgot also, - and Slawkenbergius only left, - there would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses, and every thing else, - at matin, noon, and vespers was Hafen Slawkenbergius his recreation and delight: 'twas for ever in his hands, - you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's prayer-book, - so worn, so glazed, so contrited</p>
             
             <pb n="201" xml:id="pb-201" facs="#i207"/>
             <p>and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the other.</p>
             <p>I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius, as my father; - there is a fund in him, no doubt; but in my opinion, the best, I don't say the most profitable, but the most amusing part of Hafen Slawkenbergius, is his tales, - and, considering he was a German, many of them told not without fancy: - these take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten tales. - Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore 'twas certainly wrong in Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by that name; - there are a few of them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem rather playful and sportive, than speculative, - but in general</p>
             
             <pb n="202" xml:id="pb-202" facs="#i208"/>
             <p>they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject, and collected by him with great fidelity, and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.</p>
             <p>As we have leisure enough upon our hands, - if you give me leave, madam, I'll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad.</p>
