             <p>VOL. I. PART II.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXIII.</p>
             <p>Containing Questions and Answers.</p>
             <p>'I Would not willingly discourage a new author; - but really your work appears to me to be very deficient, in the main articles which recommend books of travels: namely; antiquity, politics, taste, town-talk; - and even upon the score of common curiosity.</p>
             
            <pb n="2" xml:id="pb-2" facs="#i6"/>
             <p>'In the first instance - I have not met with a single inscription, if it were but of a tomb-stone, From DOVER to BRUSSELS: - a matter which is never omitted by the curious traveller, which costs nothing, may be done by any one, and helps greatly to swell and set off a book.'</p>
             <p>I'm sorry for your disappointment - but others had discharged that task before me: - You say right, that they cost nothing - but the pains of transcribing; and pay well those who affect bloated learning.</p>
             <p>'Do you believe the vestments which are shewn at -, for Thomas a Becket's, were truly his?'</p>
             <p>I don't believe any thing about it - they might - and they might not.</p>
             
            <pb n="3" xml:id="pb-3" facs="#i7"/>
             <p>'Downright scepticism! - The same answer might be given as to the identity of numberless relics, which one meets with here and there - and up and down.' -</p>
             <p>For which reason you may save yourself the trouble of asking.</p>
             <p>'It often happens that your grave ones are shrewd politicians - for gravity is the true vizard of politics. - I would fain know then, what power you suppose will next have the keys of OSTENDE, in case of a rupture?'</p>
             <p>I have not considered the question.</p>
             <p>'Nor any other I believe, in my conscience! - How often have BRUGES, GHENT, ALOST, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. changed their masters; been taken and retaken; conquered and ceded?'</p>
             
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i8"/>
             <p>Almost as often as FLANDERS has been made a slaughter-house; and the cutting of christian throats, has been the diversion of certain christian princes.</p>
             <p>'Are the present GHENTINGS, or Gantois, as zealous sticklers for their liberty, as their ancestors appear to have been?'</p>
             <p>Full as much - for the liberty of saying their prayers.</p>
             <p>'You don't seem to be over and above versed in these matters: - But the arts afford an ample field; and I could wish you had been a little more explicit upon their painting and statuary.'</p>
             <p>Too much has been said already upon what is in general so little understood: - For, pray tell me - what man</p>
             
            <pb n="5" xml:id="pb-5" facs="#i9"/>
             <p>ever conceived a picture, or a statue, such as it really is, by the best description which may be written of it?</p>
             <p>'Since none of those subjects seem suited to your humour, it remains that you make us some amends by freely communicating all the little-dirty-yet interesting anecdotes you have been able to glean. - Gaming, I'm told, is carried to an amazing height at BRUSSELS?'</p>
             <p>So I fear it is in almost every city in EUROPE.</p>
             <p>'Nay, but there are false counts, sham marquisses, and professed sharpers, as they say, even int he court!'</p>
             <p>There are professed scoundrels in all courts.</p>
             
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i10"/>
             <p>'The ladies too, I've heard, drive strange bargains, and make losing barters!'</p>
             <p>The ladies are, or ought to be, the guardians of those precious caskets their own honour; and the cabinets of their own secrets - I never sought to violate the one, nor to pry into the other.</p>
             <p>'They paint, it seems, furiously, one and all!'</p>
             <p>No wonder, as long as paint begets flatterers: - If the gentlemen would, one and all, shew their detestation of it, there is no question but they would soon give over that abominable practice.</p>
             <p>'Sdeath! this is not the thing - I must descend to the more familiar - common topics suit best with common</p>
             
            <pb n="7" xml:id="pb-7" facs="#i11"/>
             <p>travellers. - How many horses has Princes CHARLES in his stable?'</p>
             <p>I did not enquire.</p>
             <p>'Stupidity! - How many services has he at his table?'</p>
             <p>As many, I should imagine, as his steward of the kitchen thinks proper.</p>
             <p>'Does he eat heartily?'</p>
             <p>I suppose so - when his royal highness is hungry.</p>

             <p>Look you, Mr. Querist, I am not obliged to answer every fool's impertinence! - You may receive satisfaction in most of your points, from twenty different TRIPS and TOURS. - I set out upon another plan; and if you like my method, you are heartily welcome to it - paying the bookseller FIVE SHILLINGS.</p>
             <p>CHAP. XXIV.</p>
             <p>An Invective against Itinerant Knaves and Fools.</p>
             <p>SUCH is my regard for my native country, that, for our credit-sake, I would have an embargo laid upon the exportation of scoundrels and fools, of what class, or denomination soever: - Whether unrepenting debtors, notorious</p>
             
            <pb n="15" xml:id="pb-15" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>'Such a pack of peers!' said her grace - 'such trumpery milords!' said the countess - here the company joined in a general - he! he! he! -</p>
             <p>All but a German count, who was remarkably grave upon the occasion: - who for the space of two minutes and a half said nothing, neither acted he any thing - but by his disturbed countenance, by frequently sucking in his upper lip, and repeatedly pinching the extremity of his chin, any one might have concluded him labouring with the big thought! - which was really the case, and no less than this.</p>
             <p>He had been all along uneasy at the conversation, and debating with himself how he should put an end to it. - At length, with Austrian dignity rising up, he spoke as follows,</p>
             
            <pb n="16" xml:id="pb-16" facs="#i16"/>
             <p>'It is not for our honour!' said the count (laying his right hand upon his left breast) - and again reiterating the same words with a more forcible emphasis - 'I say, mesdames, it is not for our honour! - (raising his head, and throwing back his shoulders at the same instant) - to waste more time upon such worthless subjects! -</p>
             <p>'I cannot remember them but with abhorrence! (pursing his brows) - with detestation! (gnashing his teeth) - When I revolve, that no condition of life is exempted from affronts, and that even Austrian greatness may be insulted! - Gods! what am I? - (putting on a Croatian face.)</p>
             <p>The young marchioness was so far from being intimidated at those big words, that it was observed she simpered; but no body knew from what motive.</p>
             
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i17"/>
             <p>The true cause, as I understood, was; that, in her discerning eyes, those pretended Milords had been always doubtful characters; - tho' the count's aversion to them, had never shewn itself while they were flush with money; during which short period, he had won considerable sums from their lordships.</p>
             <p><note>French</note>Ce sont des malheureux! said the duchess, scornfully - Des fripons! said the countess, smiling - Des mechants! said the young marchioness, lisping - Des geux! said the count, thundering!</p>
             <p>Apparemment! said the duchess - Sans doute! said the countess - Assurement! said the marchioness - Croyez moi! said the count, with an air of triumph.</p>
             <p>What company was that that arrived just now at the hotel d'Angleterre?</p>
             
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pb-18" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>'A crew of noisy Englishmen! - They have left LONDON upon a ten days party - to see a play, to laugh heartily at the friars, to steal a nun apiece (if possible) or failing therein, each to have his battered Brussels wh- and a skin full of Burgundy. - Englishmen are always at home - hark! they begin to roar already.'</p>
             <p>But, it seems, a message was sent to them next day from a principal magistrate, desiring the favour of Messieurs les Anglois to be more reserved in their behaviour; more guarded in their expressions; less boisterous in their cups. - 'Tis no new thing for les Messieurs Anglois to be called to order. - I don't know how the company relished it; but I confess I thought it a very polite way of proceeding.</p>
             
            <pb n="19" xml:id="pb-19" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>'We make shift to live - (said the placid Chevalier De ***, to an English pensioner of two thousand pounds a year) - tho' our estates are not so large, nor our employments so lucrative as in ENGLAND.'</p>
             <p>"We should hardly account it living at all, replied Squire BLUNT."</p>
             <p>'We have as few wants as our neighbours, continued the Chevalier - so few, that, in truth, I am not sensible of any.'</p>
             <p>"There is a total want of English manners!" (returned DICK LOOBY:) - "Of English cheer!" said young GUTTLE: - "Of English liberty!" roared out JACK BRITON.</p>
             
            <pb n="20" xml:id="pb-20" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>'You deafen me! gentlemen,' said the Chevalier - (holding his hand up to the side of his head.)</p>
             <p>"Ha! ha! ha! hah! - Shew me a FLEMING who can laugh like that!" said JACK. - A choral laugh ensued!</p>
             <p>'Messieurs, said the Chevalier, rising, je vous souhait la bonne nuit!'</p>
             <p>'Pray inform that English gentleman (if he is a gentleman) said Monsieur BALLIEU, that open gallantries are not permitted here: - The ladies have free liberty to veil their faces as much as they think fit; nor are there public devotions to be interrupted, with impertinent whispers and indecent oglings.'</p>
             <p>Upon another occasion, the same Monsieur BALLIEU observed - 'That</p>
             
            <pb n="21" xml:id="pb-21" facs="#i21"/>
             <p>the morals of the people were the especial concern of the magistracy; nor would they suffer them to be corrupted by idle and dissolute foreigners, of what country soever.'</p>
             <p>"I am shocked at that stranger's libertinism!" said a sensible Flemish burgomaster - "Who is he?" - Answer was made, that he was an Englishman, and a Freethinker.</p>
             <p>"I judged he was an Englishman, replied the burgo-master; but cannot from his behaviour tell what a Freethinker means. - Does it give him a licence to turn all religious professions into ridicule? - I should suppose it did: - for, during the celebration of our most solemn mystery, I observed that he endeavoured to make a mockery of the whole.</p>
             
            <pb n="22" xml:id="pb-22" facs="#i22"/>
             <p>"Tell him, from me, that temples and altars, priests and rites are sacred things with us (as indeed I apprehended they were every where) and may not be affronted! - Tell him also, that if he offends again in like manner, due punishment, with us, is sure to follow wilful and malicious transgression!"</p>
             <p>Several gentlemen employed in the revenue, were a good deal puzzled, not long since, upon the sudden arrival of an English politician; who was very importunate to see the minister; - assuring them, every hour's delay was of the utmost consequence.</p>
             <p>'Bless me! sir, said one of the secretaries (who had been used to business) if your dispatches are of a public nature, how comes it (in the name of Heaven!) they were not sent to the English ambassador?'</p>
             
            <pb n="23" xml:id="pb-23" facs="#i23"/>
             <p>"He is as much in the dark, replied the politician, as you are.'</p>
             <p>Upon his first and final audience, with an air of confidence - he thus addressed the minister.</p>
             <p>'My lord - your lordship don't know me - that's the first thing I have to observe - but we may come to be better acquainted shortly -</p>
             <p>'Your lordship is to understand that I am an ENGLISHMAN - a BRITON, my lord! - no vassal of an usurped power - nor no enfranchised minion, once a slave; but a free-born British subject! - Subject? - ay, but no farther than I see right and fit -</p>
             <p>'As I said before, my lord, a free-born Briton - once a Briton, you are to understand, and always a Briton! - Pray, my lord, observe me.' -</p>
             
            <pb n="24" xml:id="pb-24" facs="#i24"/>
             <p>I do observe you, said the minister (twirling a piece of paper between his thumb and finger).</p>
             <p>'We must be private, my lord! - I hope no body can over-hear us!' - (looking cautiously round.)</p>
             <p>I hope not, answered his lordship.</p>
             <p>'As an ENGLISHMAN, my lord, I have been always accustomed to say and do whatever I like, and to come and go wherever I list: - 'Tis my birthright, my lord - my prerogative! -</p>
             <p>'Judge then what I suffered in the exchange, the moment my feet kissed the queen's ground! - to be stopt! my lord - to be interrogated! - O what a falling off from natural liberty was there! -</p>
             
            <pb n="25" xml:id="pb-25" facs="#i25"/>
             <p>''Sdeath! my lord, if such an indignity had been offered me in my own country - I had it in my choice, either to have shot the fellow, or to have sworn away his life! - But in this land of bondage!' -</p>
             <p>His lordship rang the bell - saying, at the same time - pray, sir, proceed -</p>
             <p>'Now, my lord, continued the politician, I have a scheme for making this fertile country, as free as any upon earth!' -</p>
             <p>Here one of the secretaries entered; to whom his lordship muttered some twenty words aside; when he withdrew; - Go on, sir, said the minister.</p>
             <p>'The evil of this state, my lord, resumed he, is two-fold - The arbitrary jurisdiction of the crown, and the unconscionable power of the church! -</p>
             
            <pb n="26" xml:id="pb-26" facs="#i26"/>
             <p>both of which, though apparently steadfastly fixt - I think I could topple down in the course of the couple of years!' -</p>
             <p>You undertake great things! sir, said the minister - (with a settled gravity upon his brow.)</p>
             <p>'But no more, my lord, than what I profess myself capable of atchieving - I am no pretender - no vain talker - actions speak the man! -</p>
             <p>'There are many instruments - some good - some bad - head and hands, and all at work for the public! - The pen, a singular good one, when well guided! - and let me tell you, my lord, ENGLAND has felt the lash of my feather before now!</p>
             <p>'But as this is no part of my present business, and only touched upon</p>
             
            <pb n="27" xml:id="pb-27" facs="#i27"/>
               <p>as occasion offered; I perceive your lordship begins to be a little curious to learn the true cause of my errand hither: - that you shall know in brief - and in few words, it is this: - If this should fortunately prove a time of leisure with your lordship, I shall be happy - for believe me, my lord, I can engross your whole attention for one three months.'</p>
               <p>To the first part of the first day, sir, if you please, said the minister- (hitching himself to one side of his chair.) -</p>
               <p>The politician opened -</p>
               <p>'Not only to make a people free, but to maintain them in freedom, are my great objects! - Councils may advise, may direct - but for whom do they advise and direct? - too often for themselves - to answer their own base ends and shallow purposes. - Hence</p>
               
            <pb n="28" xml:id="pb-28" facs="#i28"/>
               <p>the mischievous confusions in government! - It follows then, the necessity that there will always be for a sober, dispassionate superintendant.</p>
               <p>'In the multitude of counsellors there is safety, says SOLOMON - I must beg leave to dissent from his majesty - your lordship and I know otherwise - he should have said, there is frequently confusion.</p>
               <p>'But to what purpose, my lord, to make free, unless we can support in freedom? - that were to make headless trunks, and sinewless arms. - We must be great, as well as free! - our name must be respectable to our friends, and in the same proportion, terrible to our enemies! - These cannot be effected but by - what? - WAYS and MEANS, my lord. - Now I shall come to my point.</p>
               
            <pb n="29" xml:id="pb-29" facs="#i29"/>
               <p>'WAYS and MEANS have been my particular study - no man has carried his researches upon those heads further - no man I may venture to affirm, since it is an allowed truth, understands them better.</p>
               <p>'I am perhaps the first who reduced them to sure principles - insomuch, that shew me your WANTS, and accept of the MEANS. - Nothing, your lordship sees, can be more explicit - the coin in your treasury is not more yours, nor readier at your command.</p>
               <p>'But does it follow, my lord, because I have been all along contented with trifling gratuities - to accept of hundreds, where thousands have been my due - that I must therefore give millions for hundreds? - Unreasonable to the last degree! -</p>
               
            <pb n="30" xml:id="pb-30" facs="#i30"/>
               <p>'If I have somewhat neglected my own private affairs, for the more weighty concerns of the public; surely the greater is my desert, and the louder my claim! -</p>
               <p>'All this our short-sighted ministry know, and feelingly know by this time! - they curse themselves, no doubt, and would gladly recover me upon any terms!</p>
               <p>'But let them learn, my lord, that 'tis dangerous to tamper with great spirits! - Disgust like mine can admit of no cure! - If commanders sometimes have abandoned their country from a sense of injury; what may we not expect from those, who have a right to command their commanders?</p>
               <p>'I should certainly have been taken care of, had I staid many days longer;</p>
               
            <pb n="31" xml:id="pb-31" facs="#i31"/>
               <p>- for, as I understood, there were several after me upon the road. -</p>
               <p>'Your lordship, will perceive that I left London precipitately, and posted hither upon the wings of resentment! - I shall not scruple therefore further to inform you, that, in my hurry, I left many things behind me; and even the necessary provision for my journey - myself begin ever, as your lordship must have observed, the ultimate object of myself. - It remains then to acquaint you, that - a trifle - a hundred ducats, or so, for the present, will not be unacceptable.'</p>
               <p>I begin to understand you, sir, said the minister - (pausing.)</p>
               <p>'It is impossible, return'd the politician, that I can be misunderstood, by one of your lordship's discernment! - (bowing.)</p>
               
            <pb n="32" xml:id="pb-32" facs="#i32"/>
               <p>'I have besides something to offer, for which I make no doubt, but we shall come to an immediate agreement. - 'Tis an inexplicable cypher, which would do honour to a prince in his secret correspondence! - A cypher, my lord, worth the first jewel in the imperial crown! - and which I challenge the devil himself to find out! - A cypher, my lord' -</p>
               <p>We have already a number of cyphers in office, interrupted the minister - (coolly.)</p>
               <p>'But not such a one as mine! my lord, reply'd the politician (hastily) - I'll be da-d, if you have!' -</p>
               <p>Here his lordship rose up with a sensible quickness, as though he had just recollected something of importance - 'We shall pay a proper attention, sir, said he, to what you have</p>
               
            <pb n="33" xml:id="pb-33" facs="#i33"/>
               <p>said; nor shall any part of it transpire - when you are wanted, you will be sent for.'</p>
               <p>Upon leaving the audience, one of the secretaries whispered the politician - 'That if he intended to sojourn much longer at BRUSSELS, an apartment would be taken for him at the Selle Broueres.'*</p>
               <p>There is nothing to be wondered at from these premises, to those who consider that, Wherever liberty reigns uncontrouled, virtues and vices will be found in extremes.</p>
               <p>In such happy soils spring up spontaneously, the fairest flowers, and the rankest weeds - the most heroic, and the basest minds - the wisest men, the greatest sots and fools.</p>

               <p>You're right, friend: - upon a presumption that I was going to do, what I never dreamt of.</p>
               <p>Does it follow, because I chose to mention his royal highness's cabinet in the first part of the head of this chapter, that I am therefore bound to give a scientifical description of its contents? - by no means.</p>

               <p>If I barely mention, that in such a part of the palace, there is to be found a suite of rooms, containing modern portraits and old japan; china and nicknacks; stuffed birds and dried fishes; together with an infinity of butterflies and beetles; snakes and hedge-hogs; crabs, perriwinkles and cockleshells, I shall have fulfilled my engagement, without entering into particulars.</p>
               <p>But if readers will arrogate to themselves the privilege of anticipating all an author has to say; no wonder books are not half read; and that the present race of critics are contented with barely skimming over tables; foreseeing at once every thing which can possibly be said upon every subject.</p>
               <p>It is for these, my brethren of the quill! that we haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness?</p>

               <p>When every puny whipster snatches the poets pen, and blots and blurs according to his own conceit - farewell to all good writing! - Men of genius I henceforward, make bavins! - there are blockheads enough to make books!</p>
               <p>Confusion light upon such wou'd-be critics! - what are they driving at? - But I'll mortify the snarling curs! - for they shall read me (if they can read) or they shall never find out what I am going to say next.</p>

               <p>You must know then, that I have reserved the particulars of this superb cabinet, with the manner in which it is digested (which may serve also as a pattern for methodizing princely collections) to be inserted in my TREATISE upon CABINETS. - Wherein I purpose to point out their utility, as they might be managed; with their total inutility, upon the footing that most of them stand at present.</p>

               <p>By such provision, the populace would be better entertained, and kept at a proper distance. - CONTEMPLATION would not be interrupted with IMPERTINENCE, nor the regions of SCIENCE (into which none should be admitted, who could not clearly distinguish between a cloud and a</p>

               <p>I shall next prove by vulgar arithmetic, that forty or fifty thousand pounds so expended, in the course of twenty years (the subjects being carefully preserved) will be worth very near, perhaps more than their original cost; consequently will be so much treasure accumulated to the family: - Whereas the neat proceed of the same</p>
               
            <pb n="40" xml:id="pb-40" facs="#i40"/>
               <p>sum, expended in the same given time, upon running horses and sporting dogs, will amount only to - a parcel of old saddles, horsecloths, watering bridles and dogs collars; consequently so much treasure alienated from the family for ever.</p>
               <p>The different effects upon the principles and manners of a people from the worth of worthlessness of their superiors, will be also slightly touched - The love of science producing a nation of men; on the contrary, an universal love of gaming, a nation of monsters.</p>
               <p>The great, I am perswaded, cannot more effectually promote the cause of learning and ingenuity, than by well regulated schools like these.</p>
               <p>We might then shortly hope for an increase of able mathematicians, and a</p>
               
            <pb n="41" xml:id="pb-41" facs="#i41"/>
               <p>decrease of subtle sharpers - or arts-masters, not of Grecian artists - of industrious mechanics, not dissolute gamblers - of natural philosophers, instead of natural fools.</p>
               <p>And lastly, with a view to providing for some ingenious, but unhappy wights, whose studies perhaps have taken an unfashionable turn; I shall beg leave to recommend such to the direction and management of the said museums.</p>
               <p>Let them be men of approved knowledge; capable of tracing the apparent beauties, the seeming deformities and the sportive exuberances of nature; and of demonstrating the principles of arts and mechanics: - May they receive their reward, rather as the bounty of their patrons, than as the wages of hirelings: - and finally, may they always</p>
               
            <pb n="42" xml:id="pb-42" facs="#i42"/>
               <p>find chairs, wherever the chaplains can find any.</p>
               <p>This work will conclude with obviating any difficulty which may arise, on account of the last-mentioned expence: - as I have no doubt but I shall be able to prove, to the entire satisfaction of their lordships, that half a dozen well-bred philosophers, will not consume so much as a couple of saucy grooms.</p>
               <p>'But still it will be expected that you should say something about the BRUSSELS cabinet.'</p>
               <p>What would you have me say? - is not a cabinet, to the generality, a cabinet? - and, as the lady observed, 'are not there a monstrous sight of charming things? - and all mighty neat, and prodigious pretty, and very sweet, and vastly clever!' -</p>
               
            <pb n="43" xml:id="pb-43" facs="#i43"/>
               <p>You're perfectly right, madam: - I think I never saw so fine a collection - well-chosen, elegantly disposed, and so happily arranged that 'twould be cruel to pull them to pieces.</p>
               <p>I fancy, madam, if I may venture to guess at a lady's fair thoughts, that you have conceived a violent passion for some of his royal highness's japan?</p>
               <p>'He! he! he! - how can you think so?'</p>
               <p>Nay indeed, madam, I could not blame you - for 'tis the finest I ever beheld.</p>
               <p>'Why then, sir - to tell you the truth - I should like to have it every bit and crum!' -</p>
               
            <pb n="44" xml:id="pb-44" facs="#i44"/>
               <p>The BRUSSELS beauties must unquestionably veil to ours of WINDSOR and HAMPTON-COURT - tho' I have no doubt but those ladies had their allurements when living, which justly entitled them to a place there: - But OURS charm even after death; and pigmalion-like, we cannot refrain from worshipping each divine resemblance!</p>
               <p>I was much pleased to find among so many objects of taste and utility, a complete chemical apparatus - it appeared to me to be placed there with great propriety.</p>
               <p>This may serve, thought I, occasionally to remind some folks of their wants: - A virtuoso, attending his young lord, through these delightful meads of nature and science; may have an opportunity of whispering him, some of the numberless advantages to pleasure and profit, arising from</p>
               
            <pb n="45" xml:id="pb-45" facs="#i45"/>
               <p>knowledge of chemistry. - For tell me, ye experienced sages! what study is so befitting the mind of man - so becoming the patronage of a prince, as that upon which most arts and manufactures depend? - The ready clue to countless abstract causes and effects! - The only key by which we can unlock the mysteries of nature!</p>
               <p>Naturalists, upon entering the great room, are apt to be struck with the just proportions of the Polish dwarf; an human figure, at man's estate, not exceeding in stature <note>Gap in text</note> inches, and weighing only <note>Gap in text</note> pounds. - But the ladies, I perceive, are more smitten with his companion the monkey; who, coxcomically drest, and erect upon his hinder legs, seems to turn away from his brother mimic with an air of contempt.</p>
               
            <pb n="46" xml:id="pb-46" facs="#i46"/>
               <p>The cabinet of engraved stones, late Queen CHRISTINA's of SWEDEN, is certainly a very valuable acquisition to the BRUSSELS museum: - but it would require more time to examine a single cameo, than is allowed for viewing the whole.</p>
               <p>The same observation will hold good respecting the natural rarities: - the mechanical dispatch which is used in shewing you what is called every thing - pulling out one drawer, and skipping five or six above and below, is vastly entertaining; and proves that an easy knack can only be acquired by habit: - If any rare subject happens to catch the eye, lest it should occasion some controversy, popping in that drawer, and whipping out another, in order to divert the attention - and so of the rest in succession, till you have skimmed over the whole.</p>
               
            <pb n="47" xml:id="pb-47" facs="#i47"/>
               <p>'Tis surely the prettiest confusion that can be devised - and what fine ladies and fine gentlemen, for the most part, are very fond of. -</p>
               <p>'Tis exactly similar with our own raree-shew at Montagu-Hosue - and I know of no difference, save that as the British-museum is the only gratis-shew in ENGLAND, you carry your ticket in your hand - whereas the Brussels-cabinet is among the few foreign ones, to which you are admitted by virtue of a ticket in your pocket.</p>
               <p>The models of the several arts and trades appeared to me to have infinite merit, not only upon the score of curiosity, but of real utility: - they are certainly happily conceived, well executed, and no less ornamental.</p>
               <p>I should think his royal highness would be frequently sollicited to have</p>
               
            <pb n="48" xml:id="pb-48" facs="#i48"/>
               <p>them copied and improved; as they would be a very useful addition to any prince's cabinet.</p>
               <p>I apprehend a course of lectures upon such models, would make a proper part of the education of young noblemen. - They might learn from them how the bulk of mankind are employed - their humanity would be enlarged upon that consideration: - in some cases they would admire and wish to reward that ingenuity which they ne'er can rival - in others, they would often commiserate, what they now wantonly despise. - In a word, they would soon perceive the riches of a nation depended, in a great measure, upon its arts and manufactures; and that its best security, was the virtuous industry of the people.</p>
               
            <pb n="49" xml:id="pb-49" facs="#i49"/>
               <p>One of our party at this philosophical banquet, happened to be monsieur NERON; successor to the famous MAUBERT, in the weighty business of conducting the BRUSSELS-gazette.</p>
               <p>Mr. K. secretary to our minister, from whom I received many civilities, did me the favour to introduce me to him. - I was much taken with the unaffected simplicity of the character, and invited him to dine with me at our inn; which he accepted.</p>
               <p>Monsieur MAUBERT, he informed me, from a series of unhappy events, was likely to pass the remainder of his days in prison. - Poor gentleman! said I. -</p>
               <p>'Do you pity him?' returned monsieur NERON - 'can an ENGLISHMAN compassionate the downfall of MAUBERT?'</p>
               
            <pb n="50" xml:id="pb-50" facs="#i50"/>
               <p>No doubt, said I - we ought to pity, not to rejoice at the distress of our enemies: - this is not the private sentiment of an individual, but the voice of a people - so general, that 'tis even become a part of our national virtue.</p>
               <p>'The ENGLISH have unquestionably great virtue,' said monsieur NERON.</p>
               <p>I wish, said I, for their own sake, they knew how much they were possest of - so that, by reflection, they might abate of their many follies and absurdities which lessen and deform it.</p>
               <p>What subject, in the name of good manners! would you have had started, but politics, to a professed politician? - In which case, there's nothing like sousing into the midst of things at once.</p>
               
            <pb n="51" xml:id="pb-51" facs="#i51"/>
               <p>I look upon ENGLAND, sir, said I, to be the only land of LIBERTY and free intelligence! -</p>
               <p>'Hum!' - said monsieur NERON.</p>
               <p>The former indeed cannot exist, with any degree of assurance, without the latter.</p>
               <p>'Hum!' said monsieur NERON again.</p>
               <p>Now, sir, I apprehend it is but of little use to the public that men think freely, if they dare not as freely communicate. -</p>
               <p>'Freely communicate!' - reiterated monsieur NERON.</p>
               <p>- Some native sparks of freedom, I grant you, are to be found every where - but then they are either choaked up,</p>
               
            <pb n="52" xml:id="pb-52" facs="#i52"/>
               <p>or lie buried in the embers of state-policy: - 'Tis in ENGLAND only that they are suffered to blaze forth, diffusing a generous warmth to all her children! -</p>
               <p>'I am sorry you don't like our snuff,' interrupted monsieur NERON - at the same time presenting me his box. -</p>
               <p>- With you, continued I, it is at the will of the sovereign, or with the privilege of the states - but with us, it is at the sovereign will of an independent printer; who may be a citizen of LONDON, or a denizen of some inconsiderable market-town (for that makes no difference) - the man is equally free, being an Englishman, to print and act without controul, in whatever part of the kingdom he chuses to reside.</p>
               
            <pb n="53" xml:id="pb-53" facs="#i53"/>
               <p>In several of our country-towns, which it may be are a fourth, or a fifth part as big, though not a fortieth as considerable as BRUSSELS, we have one, two, perhaps three news-papers a week; besides upwards of sixty that are every seven days, issued from the London-presses. -</p>
               <p>I am of opinion we should not strain the computation by advancing, that South-Britain alone furnishes more printed intelligence, such as it is, in one week, than the whole continent of EUROPE in half a year! -</p>
               <p>'The land of news-papers!' said monsieur NERON.</p>
               <p>Ay, and the glory of all lands! said I. - To those fiddles of dissention, we dance an everlasting courant! - By means of those vehicles of clamour, we keep up the spirits of the people,</p>
               
            <pb n="54" xml:id="pb-54" facs="#i54"/>
               <p>the ball of contention, and the ballance of party! -</p>
               <p>'We have no parties among us,' said monsieur NERON.</p>
               <p>So much the worse! - Party is the life-blood of liberty! - If you have no avowed parties already, study to divide the common interests of the people; and, my life on't! you'll have parties enough.</p>
               <p>'We rather study to unite - to cement them more closely,' said Mr. NERON.</p>
               <p>O damned lethargic system! - in which case, what does it signify who are in?</p>
               <p>'Not much indeed,' reply'd my new acquaintance, 'according to our</p>
               
            <pb n="55" xml:id="pb-55" facs="#i55"/>
               <p>notion; so that the public welfare is promoted.'</p>
               <p>What have you no choice? - no friends whom you would wish to see preferred; for whose advancement you would drink away your senses? - no unshaken patriots, for whom you would roar your souls out? - no favourite statesmen, to whom you would sacrifice yourselves, your wives and all your children?</p>
               <p>'They are not of our choosing,' said the Gazetteer.</p>
               <p>I cry you mercy! but with us they are - We raise 'em, we sink 'em. - If we like the men, it may be that we dislike their measures (out with them! cries one party) - If we like the measures, 'tis possible we hate the men (down with them! cries another) - We praise 'em, we abuse 'em alternately -</p>
               
            <pb n="56" xml:id="pb-56" facs="#i56"/>
               <p>In short, we rate 'em in - we bait 'em out!</p>
               <p>'Scandal is severely punished with us,' said Mr. NERON.</p>
               <p>Who talks of scandal? - no such thing was ever meant - 'Tis nothing but harmless POLITICAL LYING - It serves to amuse, to divert - to set people a laughing! -</p>
               <p>'You often laugh in ENGLAND, at what would make any other nation tremble for you, and for themselves!'</p>
               <p>If they were our relations indeed - our loving brothers and our loving cousins, as we call them - or grant you, they were our friends; some shew of concern might follow: - But as political friendship has the same basis with commercial (mutual conveniency) there</p>
               <p></p>
               
            <pb n="57" xml:id="pb-57" facs="#i57"/>
               <p>can be no doubt but that, occasionally, we make our neighbours laugh too.</p>
               <p>'Strangers are often puzzled to find out the joke.</p>
               <p>'I don't comprehend you,' said monsieur NERON - (looking wistfully at me.)</p>
               <p>Why the joke lies - in the puzzle. -</p>
               <p>But besides the political entertainment which our public papers afford, we derive from them a great number of substantial benefits. - I shall instance only two - the first respects the laws. - Our new-writers, you are to understand, are the laws chief supporters, and their tip-top expositors! -</p>
               <p>'The laws with us support themselves,' returned monsieur NERON.</p>
               
            <pb n="58" xml:id="pb-58" facs="#i58"/>
               <p>The second regards the peace - Our gazetteers are wonderful guardians of the peace! and daily point out to the magistracy their duty.</p>
               <p>'Our magistrates, for their own honour, preserve the peace,' said monsieur NERON - 'they want no monitors.'</p>
               <p>Then for miscellaneous matter, each paper is a perfect posy!</p>
               <p>Those gentlemen may be also considered as a kind of unlicenced lictors - not a private folly, or misfortune escapes them: - With their fasces of goose-quils they lash and scourge away most unmercifully! -</p>
               <p>We laugh immoderately at others sores; and admire the ingenuity that can effectually ruin a man, without hurting a hair of his head, or touching a penny of his property!</p>
               
            <pb n="59" xml:id="pb-59" facs="#i59"/>
               <p>But really it becomes serious, when we begin to reflect, that nobody knows who may be tied up next! - You may laugh now - but it may be your turn by and by.</p>
               <p>After all, you see plainly, no harm was intended - 'twas nothing but a joke.</p>
               <p>'O monstrous! - such inhuman jesters would not be suffered to live in any other country! - If this is LIBERTY, long may you enjoy it!' -</p>
               <p>And you your lethargy, and thread-bare virtue,</p>
               <p>'I should rather have said - may you enjoy it, till the surfeiting abuse opens your eyes! - for the present, I would not wish my enemy to have less.'</p>
               <p>Bon jour! monsieur NERON.</p>

               <p>In which the Traveller affects the Politician.</p>
               <p>'CURSE on their dirty work! - where do they find tools?'</p>
               <p>You need not trouble yourself about that - there are always enough to be found.</p>
               <p>Some, grown rusty with laying by, at a small expence of furbishing, may be brought into play again: - some, blunted by disappointment, may cost a little whetting: - others, worn down with hard service, upon being fresh ground, will last a long while.</p>
               <p>Besides these old and familiar ones, there are entire new instruments ever at hand, which may answer as well,</p>
               
            <pb n="61" xml:id="pb-61" facs="#i61"/>
               <p>perhaps better,than the former, when once the methods of application are learnt - and that, you know, depends upon trial and practice.</p>
               <p>Some lawyers, are so many ready made: - and now and then a church-man, convinced that Godliness is not profitable for all things, may for a while dispense with the duties of his sacred function, and become more eminently distinguished as a brawler of SEDITION, than as a preacher of PEACE.</p>
               <p>But be not deceived, my dear countrymen! - All are not the tools of FACTION, whose only ambition is to be thought of that wretched importance.</p>
               <p>The greatest number of those pretended malecontents (men destitute alike of principles and of professions) are simply tempted of the devil, and their own evil minds, to become party-pamphletteers and literary assassins; - so that they</p>
               
            <pb n="62" xml:id="pb-62" facs="#i62"/>
               <p>can but screen their worthlessness behind some dirty, mercenary publisher: - or, they are retainers to lying gazetteers, and scandalous chroniclers.</p>
               <p>In their politics, you would believe them to be the most disinterested patriots upon earth; - in their calumnies, you would consider them as injured and abused parties: -</p>
               <p>The spirit of public zeal animates the one; the warmth of domestic affection, or partial friendship breathes through the other: - In either case, harshness of expression, becomes warrantable error, when the cause of injured virtue provokes our resentment.</p>
               <p>'Tis all a cheat, take my word for it, from the beginning to the end! - they are not the hundredth part so much affected, as they would wish to make you believe: - in proof whereof, you shall</p>
               
            <pb n="63" xml:id="pb-63" facs="#i63"/>
               <p>have them every one on the opposite side, if you chuse it.</p>
               <p>'Tis their vocation - they live upon the LYE of to-day and the SLANDER of to-morrow, and swine-like fatten upon filth and ordure: - should such scurvy diet fail, they must starve before the week were at an end.</p>
               <p>If one of those wayward sons of DETRACTION should assert, that his grace refused; what he never had in his offer - that he protested against measures; when he openly avowed the contrary: - That his lordship had planned the ruin of his country; which he had laboured incessantly to magnify - that he despised fair FAME, and courted DISHONOUR: - Believe him not.</p>
               <p>If he protests that he was privy to the one, and can produce indubitable testimony of the other; discredit him</p>
               
            <pb n="64" xml:id="pb-64" facs="#i64"/>
               <p>the more. - If he offers to pawn his honour for the truth - alas! he has no honour to stake! - If he would establish the falshoods by oaths; they can only serve to add to the measure of his perjuries.</p>
               <p>O Heav'n! that such companions thou'd'st unfold,</p>
               <p>And put in every honest hand a whip,</p>
               <p>To last the rascals naked thro' the world!</p>
               <p>Besides these, there are certain volunteer incendiaries; the only patrons, if they have any, of the former - Men who delight in mischief! - professing in-dependency, but promoting distraction! - who sicken at the public tranquility! - who seek to destroy the haven of CONCORD, and preach up, that the vessel can never be safe but in a storm! -</p>
               <p>These are so many sworn foes to the sunshine of PEACE; who endure not</p>

               <p>Such miscreated beings would delight to be curious spectators of the general conflagration; and steadfastly to abide the wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds, might they do it in safety to themselves!</p>
               <p>In default of that grand event, they are contented each to bear his brand to the fuel of DISCONTENT; and, at a distance, to admire how gloriously! - (without once reflecting) - how fatally it burns!</p>
               <p>Droop not, my COUNTRY'S GENIUS! nor thou, fair VIRTUE! hang thy dejected head, impatient of the mischief, despairing of the cure! -</p>

            <pb n="67" xml:id="pb-67" facs="#i67"/>
               <p>to the fancied wants of pretended virtu.</p>
               <p>Those reptiles, to the disgrace of what the world calls parts, play off little craft for knowledge; and cunning for foresight; - to neither of which they have the smallest pretensions, independent of tricking: however it often suits their customers, and turns to very good account to themselves. -</p>
               <p>If you have a mind to try their skill upon any other subject, you will be sure to find them totally deficient: but when you come to speak of originals and copies; of the true medal and the false; of the first or last impression; of the rare or common shell - they will amazingly talk and shrug away not only your eyes, but your understanding altogether.</p>
               
            <pb n="68" xml:id="pb-68" facs="#i68"/>
               <p>'Tis seemingly a difficult, complicated part which the designing knave has to act; - yet it must be easily attainable, since we find the lowest wretches possessed of it.</p>
               <p>If he has to cope with ignorance; a little lying self-sufficiency will answer - when he meets with his match, 'tis his turn to play the ignorant - but the most profitable game, is to let people cheat themselves.</p>
               <p>I admire that fellow's impudence who could palm such a wretched copy upon his lordship, for an original - such a one as the master, were he living, would spurn at! - But, it seems, he head the art previously to persuade his lordship he was a most consummate judge.</p>
               <p>"VAN VERNIS, thou'rt a flattering rogue!" said his lordship. - He is indeed,</p>
               
            <pb n="69" xml:id="pb-69" facs="#i69"/>
               <p>my lord - and yet you reward him for it.</p>
               <p>'I hope not, my lord, reply'd VAN VERNIS, by joining in the general consent - or if flattery; it is not I, but the world that flatters your lordship.'</p>
               <p>Well said, my second-hand artist! - the picture is sold - you have cleared up a doubt in his lordship's mind, which nobody ever doubted of before, but himself. - Believe me, he has too much politeness towards you, and tenderness for himself ever to gainsay your assertion.</p>
               <p>'The picture is yours, my lord, said VAN VERNIS - through I can hardly find in my heart to part with it (sighing!) - I have several times refused as many ducats as would cover it! - but I had always a singular satisfaction in looking at it myself, which</p>
               
            <pb n="70" xml:id="pb-70" facs="#i70"/>
               <p>paid me more than the interest of the money (forcing a tear of joy!) - Five hundred ducats, to be sure, is a poor consideration for such a piece! - A man may find ducats much faster than he can meet with such morsels! (taking a final look.) -</p>
               <p>'If it had not been to your lordship, or one of your country, no one should have had it at that price: - Believe me, my lord, a FRENCHMAN should not have had it for double! -</p>
               <p>'But the ENGLISH are noble, are generous, and love to part with their money! - they know good things and will have them, coutent qui coutent!' -</p>
               <p>"VAN VERNIS, said his lordship, by g-d! thou'rt an honest fellow! by g-d! - I didn't expect it for less than a thousand, dammee! - but it shall be thousands in your way, sirrah! - I'll</p>
               
            <pb n="71" xml:id="pb-71" facs="#i71"/>
               <p>puff you off for the prince of picture-dealers wherever I go, dammee! -</p>
               <p>"Several of my friends are fitting up cabinets just now; and they shall buy all your pictures and antiques! - we'll have 'em over in ship-loads! - the FRENCH sha'n't have one of 'em, dammee! - We'll send you bills upon the Bank of ENGLAND for your money, and make a man of you at once, you dog!"</p>
               <p>Unfortunately connoisseurship happened to be no part of his lordship's character - he might have been reasonably happy in that of a worthy patriot: - But then what must have become of poor VAN VERNIS?</p>
               <p>'It is a very nice part of our profession, says VAN, to bestow liberally upon the opulent, that which nature has denied them - to lend them eyes to</p>
               
            <pb n="72" xml:id="pb-72" facs="#i72"/>
               <p>see; and above all, to give them sufficient judgment to become their own dupes.</p>
               <p>'In case of a detection, most commonly, for their own sakes, 'tis smothered - or should some dissatisfaction arise (as in the instance before us) how easy a matter to turn it upon themselves?'</p>
               <p>'I am no painter, my lord - my knowledge is simply that of a dealer - indeed, I was rather doubtful, till your lordship confirmed the originality. - Your lordship saw, admired, and believed it to be such - Was it for me to set up my poor judgment, in opposition to your lordship's?' -</p>
               <p>"Take it away! VAN VERNIS, said his lordship - da-n the picture! - take it out of my sight! - Poor fellow! - don't lay it so much to heart! - Hang</p>
               
            <pb n="73" xml:id="pb-73" facs="#i73"/>
               <p>- Hang the money! - I don't mind money! - and for the picture, take it home with thee - 'tis but a paultry consideration for the pain thou hast suffered" -</p>
               <p>'Your lordship was always very considerate! reply'd VAN VERNIS - but I'll take care that no generous Nobleman, shall hereafter be imposed upon by this picture, as your lordship and myself have been. - I'll deface it them oment I get it home!' -</p>
               <p>"'Tis thine - do what thou wilt with it," said his lordship.</p>
               <p>'- For now that I recollect, my lord, I believe I know where the true picture is.' -</p>
               <p>"Say'st thou so? - Is it come-at-able?"</p>
               
            <pb n="74" xml:id="pb-74" facs="#i74"/>
               <p>'I don't care to be positive, after such a mistake - and yet I think I might rest my salvation upon the reality!' -</p>
               <p>"Procure me that - and set your own price upon it!"</p>
               <p>'As to price, my lord - I wou'd give double the sum this accident had not happened.' -</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! rot the accident! - the best of us may be out sometimes." -</p>
               <p>'Of that I am fully convinced now, my lord! - and the conviction has so humbled me, that I never more will offer a piece of price upon my own judgment.'</p>
               <p>"You're in the right, VAN! - well, set about it straight!" -</p>
               
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pb-75" facs="#i75"/>
               <p>'The moment I get home, assure your lordship.'</p>
               <p>Within a week, VAN VERNIS produced the self-same picture - but so new modified, that his lordship was perfectly satisfied with the originality; and frankly paid a thousand ducats for the same.'</p>
               <p>'I am sorry, my lord, said VAN, that we haven't the copy to compare it with - but, unfortunately, I parted with it for ten ducats, to a chapman who attends fairs, only three days ago.'</p>
               <p>"O curse all COPIES! replied his lordship - as long as we can get ORIGINALS."</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXVIII.</p>
               <p>A few general Remarks upon Brussels, with some particular ones on the Beguinage.</p>
               <p>'TIS fine talking of seeing every thing in three or four days in such a capital as BRUSSELS, and being acquainted with the people into the bargain! - Commend me to such ingrossers of curiosity!</p>
               <p>This brings to my mind some of my country friends, who in their week's jaunt to LONDON, pretended also, that they had seen every thing - And pray what did you see?</p>
               <p>'Why, WESTMINSTER-ABBEY, and its matchless monuments - St. Paul's Cathedral, and its naked majesty - the pillar of fire, and its smoaky prospect -</p>
               
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pb-77" facs="#i77"/>
               <p>the Tower and the roaring lions - the wax-work, not forgetting MOTHER SHIPTON!' -</p>
               <p>That's enough - and more by all that you have mentioned than you could have seen, had you never stirred from home.</p>
               <p>But where to begin my remarks? - that's the question.</p>
               <p>I once thought of expending a great part of this chapter upon the subject of public ministers residing at foreign courts. -</p>
               <p>'Hey day! - Why what the plague can that have to do with BRUSSELS, more than any other court?'</p>
               <p>True, my accomplished friend! - and it was upon that consideration, I laid my design aside. - It may be introduced</p>
               
            <pb n="78" xml:id="pb-78" facs="#i78"/>
               <p>with more propriety upon another occasion - but I shall never have a fairer opportunity of acknowledging the polite reception I met with at the English Ambassador's, and the elegant entertainment which our company partook of there.</p>
               <p>In grateful remembrance whereof suffer me to add, That politeness of manners, and elegance of living, appear to me to be highly requisite in public characters; who study the honour of their sovereigns, more than their own emolument: - Whereas such base spirits as seek to enrich themselves, where parsimony becomes a vice; are rather the ministers of their own avarice, than of their country.</p>
               <p>I confess that BRUSSELS with all her boasted beauty, fell short of my expectation. - I found in her little to be admired</p>
               
            <pb n="79" xml:id="pb-79" facs="#i79"/>
               <p>but fountains and crooked streets; if we except the public edifices, some of which are very grand. -</p>
               <p>The several ascents to the palace, frequently reminded me of Snow-hill - in the way you meet with a magnificent pile of ruins, which has lain in much the same condition for these forty years; but which, with us, would have been cleared in a few months.</p>
               <p>But the court, the theatre, the brilliant assemblies, the agreeable promenades, the fashionable course - those are the charms of BRUSSELS! - and to such as can enter into them with spirit, it must be accounted a delicious place: - To such then I leave them, for the sake of more important researches.</p>
               <p>Peace be to the pious ashes of Saint BEGA! the foundress and patroness of those religious female colonies called</p>
               
            <pb n="80" xml:id="pb-80" facs="#i80"/>
               <p>Beguinages: - and whether thou wert queen, priestess, or prophetess - virgin, wife, or widow - or all, or neither; it matters not to me. -</p>
               <p>Let MONKISH SUPERSTITION blason thy hallowed dust; and IGNORANCE invent to thy honour far more than is necessary to be believed: - such legendary records may add to our wonder, but cannot increase our praise. -</p>
               <p>If by thy bright example, thousands of thy loved sex have been sheltered from want, and shielded from prostitution; millions of thanks we owe to thy memory! -</p>
               <p>If by receiving thy gentle rule, they have been cut off from the corruptions, but not from the commerce of the flesh - and tho' recommended to enjoy a life of celibacy, nevertheless are not debarred the freedom of wedded felicity, when</p>
               
            <pb n="81" xml:id="pb-81" facs="#i81"/>
               <p>suitable matches offer; what songs of praise shall we not render thee? -</p>
               <p>In the mean while, by sober industry, each to employ her talent towards her own support; in various needlework, weaving lace, knitting purses, washing prints, fashioning and dressing dolls; <note>there is a black line between 'dolls' and the punctuation</note> and, the elder ones, in nursing the sick at their respective houses,</p>
               <p>Well, after all, this seems to be no absurd institution - and something like it might be admitted into any corporation, whether popish, or protestant. - I will subscribe to it with all my heart, for the love I bear the sex.</p>
               <p>No wonder that where such provision is made for frail virtue, profligate vice is not rampant in every street, to the annoyance of the sober, and the destruction of the unwary: - that goals and bridewells are not overloaded with</p>
               
            <pb n="82" xml:id="pb-82" facs="#i82"/>
               <p>such delinquents; and finally that they are not freighted off in ship-loads to poison foreign plantations, after having done their worst at home. -</p>
               <p>Such a preventive for the most fatal and complicated mischief, is, in my poor opinion, to be preferred to speculative and patched-up cures.</p>
               <p>There is seldom a remedy for idleness, when the habit of industry is lost - no room for good seed to spring up, where the soil is choaked with weeds.</p>
               <p>'Imployments are wanting, is the common cry; and support in the mean time must be had.' - How so? - these people you find employ and support themselves; - and so they might any where, under proper regulation.</p>
               <p>It is not an hospital, or a row of alms-houses, into which none but the wretched are admitted - bit 'tis a little</p>
               
            <pb n="83" xml:id="pb-83" facs="#i83"/>
               <p>hamlet within itself, enclosed with walls and gates; containing fifty, an hundred, perhaps two hundred tenements, ranged in several neat streets, with a handsome church or chapel. -</p>
               <p>The devotees enter there of their own free will, and carry their little portions and effects, if they have any, along with them - 'tis no discredit to be of their order -t hey are not confined save to the rule of the society, but are seen every where; and whenever they think fit may resign the habit, and engage again in the business of the world.</p>
               <p>If therefore there are no avowed prostitutes in the AUSTRIAN NETHERLANDS, one reason for it is pretty obvious. - Every city has its Beguinage, containing from two hundred to five hundred, or a thousand of those virtuous spinsters called BEGUINES.</p>
               
            <pb n="84" xml:id="pb-84" facs="#i84"/>
               <p>Our fair pilot having indulged us with her courteous company for a week, from the time we left OSTENDE; found it necessary to return thither - and in complaisance for her many civilities, we could do no less than accompany her on the way as far as GHENT.</p>
               <p>And now, my good friend, said I, we shall have a little leisure to look about us - no posting back to BRUSSELS! if you please. -</p>
               <p>If the gates must be shut at seven - in God's name! let 'em shut the gates - we'll sleep upon the road, that's all.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXIX.</p>
               <p>The Traveller chides his own Inattention; but endeavours to bring himself off as handsomely as he can.</p>
               <p>WHAT have I lost! - and what may not my country have lost by this inattention - this treacherous memory of mine! -</p>
               <p>But it is impossible to remember every thing; - and considering the restraint I was under, and the hurry I was in, it may rather be admired that I have brought away so much.</p>
               <p>CORIAT returned, the ruddy cheek of HEALTH returns to the sad mourners of her absence! - Ye fenny inhabitants, shake no more! - Ye sons of moors and daughters of marshes, cheer up! - Ye Essex hundreds, and ye Kentish wealdings,</p>
               
            <pb n="86" xml:id="pb-86" facs="#i86"/>
               <p>rejoice! - for CORIAT! Sir CORIAT! your doctor! your deliverer is at hand!</p>
               <p>This might with great truth have been said. - But alas! what shall we say now? - Whatever you please.</p>
               <p>QUACKERY is so much the mode in this enquiring, this improving age - so respectable in its quality and so profitable in its consequences - that, to tell you a secret, I was not myself without some hope, upon my return, of adding one to the number of fine gradibus doctors.</p>
               <p>A single nostrum is enough to make a gentleman and a fortune - to acquire rank and equipage; and often better than a plurality: - for provided the party, for reasons best known to himself, professes only one branch; there is abundant room to think he will shine</p>
               
            <pb n="87" xml:id="pb-87" facs="#i87"/>
               <p>more conspicuously, than if she should undertake the whole catalogue of causes and cures; of diseases, with their remedies: - as a carpenter will be always the better workman, if he leaves the practice of physic entirely out of the question.</p>
               <p>Pray who is that gentleman you parted from just now? - There is a wonderful deal of gaiety in his manner; of vivacity in his look; - of consummate affability: - he really has a vast deal to say, and laughs immoderately!</p>
               <p>'It well becomes him to keep it up, and to make his patients laugh as fast as he can. - That is the facetious HIP-DOCTOR!'</p>
               <p>I admire yon equipage beyond most that rattle over the new pavement! - Do you know who's it is?</p>
               
            <pb n="88" xml:id="pb-88" facs="#i88"/>
               <p>'I don't recollect the learned gentleman's name - but he is a famous GOUT-DOCTOR!'</p>
               <p>Henceforward I shall pay more regard to common sayings - for I have often heard, that an infallible remedy for the gout would bring a man to a fine coach.</p>
               <p>That gentleman's sword-knot is one of the genteelest things I ever saw! - and I assure you there is infinite fancy in the manner of tying it on.</p>
               <p>'Don't you know him? - 'tis the celebrated TOOTH-DOCTOR! - one of the prettiest gentlemen that lives! -</p>
               <p>'He takes out your old teeth without any pain, and furnishes you with new ones which you may take out and put in at pleasure - which answer the vulgar ends of mastication, full as well as</p>
               
            <pb n="89" xml:id="pb-89" facs="#i89"/>
               <p>the natural; with the additional beauty of whiteness, and grace of evenness.'</p>
               <p>I confess that wigs are to me among the indifferent things of life; insomuch as I seldom regard how a man's head is drest, so that it turns out to be but tolerably well furnished within: - yet one must be totally blind, not to be struck with that gentleman's buckle! -</p>
               <p>'That is a very singular character indeed - the noted CORN-DOCTOR! - who has disappointed more surgeons than any man of his profession: - Who defies them all! - calls them a parcel of jacks, in return for their compliment of quacks to his brethren - and declares he would have had no legs at all, if it had not been for him!'</p>
               <p>All DOCTORS, as I live! - a certain proof of the great learning, and uncommon</p>
               
            <pb n="90" xml:id="pb-90" facs="#i90"/>
               <p>industry of the age - but most of the latter. -</p>
               <p>How should it be otherwise? for now-a-days a man is not allowed even the benefit of his own discoveries: - the moment he utters them, they are no longer his, but the public's: - they are any one's for the taking up -</p>
               <p>The poor simple regular, idly conceited, if any honour, or emolument should arise from his endeavours to serve a grateful public; that it was to be all his own. - Nothing could be more ridiculous than such a conclusion! - for you see, slap! tis made a nostrum by some ignorant pretender.</p>

               <p>Such a repartee will do everlasting honour to quackery; and is certain proof that the knight had his wits about him. - Had he simply answered the question as to the disease; it might have followed, their worships would have strove hard to have found out the cure. - Now a secret, we all know is nothing; unless we keep it to ourselves,</p>
               <p>'But how can you be sure you would have succedeed?'</p>
               
            <pb n="94" xml:id="pb-94" facs="#i94"/>
               <p>I should have pushed for it, I promise you. - I have just physic enough to convince the learned in that faculty that I know nothing: - and just so much, I apprehend, is sufficient to palm myself upon a quack for a man of knowledge. - That would have been my first game - and failing in my medical capacity, I should have had an excellent after-game.</p>
               <p>'I don't comprehend you.'</p>
               <p>Priests, you must know, are much fonder of gaining souls, than of curing bodies: - if nothing less would have carried my point - perhaps - I should not have scrupled to - you understand me.</p>
               <p>'Why surely you would not have turned papist?'</p>
               <p>Any thing, my friend, rather than to have left such an inestimable secret</p>
               
            <pb n="95" xml:id="pb-95" facs="#i95"/>
               <p>behind me; and have given up such a prospect of advantage to my country! - I might have pretended so, at least - and have swallowed a few temporary oaths. -</p>
               <p>But, grant you I had only seen the father, and conversed with him for a quarter of an hour, upon his excellent art; that alone had been sufficient warrant to have published upon my return the following card, </p>
               <p>AGUES,</p>

            <pb n="96" xml:id="pb-96" facs="#i96"/>
               <p>For so that we can but acquire knowledge, and arrive at great discoveries; for heaven's sake! what does it signify how we came by them?</p>
               <p>CHAP. XXX.</p>
               <p>Wherein honourable Mention is made of mine Host at the Magi at Alost.</p>
               <p>THE three kings, they are commonly called - but look up to the sign, and you will find it to be a representation of the EASTERN MAGI:- For in this sanctified country, not only the land is consecrated, and all the inhabitants devoted to heaven; but even sign-posts, beer-barrels, pewter-platters and earthen pipkins are hallowed - and you must be totally blind indeed, if some sacred type or other does not stare you in the face, look which way you will, or upon whatever object you please.</p>
               
            <pb n="97" xml:id="pb-97" facs="#i97"/>
               <p>I shall leave to others, whom it more immediately concerns, to make their remarks thereon - 'tis no particular business of mine.</p>
               <p>As an itinerant, I could not help observing that the fruit of good living flourished among all ranks - the examples of the highest stimulated the lowest to good works - to sobriety, industry, frugality - to acts of courtesy and beneficence -</p>
               <p>Was it for me to inquire any further? - It would have been idle to have engaged in any controversy; - and must have taken up more time than I could spare, to have found out, who had the dominion of their consciences.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that in our former journey from GHENT to BRUSSELS, there was no possibility of stopping by the way, or turning to the right hand, or to the</p>
               
            <pb n="98" xml:id="pb-98" facs="#i98"/>
               <p>left - there was an absolute necessity for jogging strait forward - the lady would have it so; and there's no gain-saying the ladies.</p>
               <p>But having accompanied our fair conductor to the barge, and wished her the most poetical passage that ever woman had; to rejoice the longing eyes of her children, and the throbbing heart of her husband! - that NEREIDS might play, and dolphins dance before her! - The future direction devolved to me; partly by seniority, partly by parental authority.</p>
               <p>Foreseeing then what was likely to happen within a few hours, like a prudent successor, I had begun to lay down my play of operation; and having privately consulted my intelligent host at the MAGI at ALOST, I learnt from him that the magnificent abbey of NINOVE then rebuilding, would well requite a</p>
               
            <pb n="99" xml:id="pb-99" facs="#i99"/>
               <p>stranger's curiosity, for going seven or eight miles of our his way.</p>
               <p>To spur us on the more to this excursion, he added, 'You will be the first English company to visit it since the new foundation was laid.' - Good! mine host, said I - I have no objection at being the first in any laudable pursuit - we'll dine with you, God willing! on Friday - in the mean time you will provide a coach, and soon after dinner we'll set off: - To make it the more agreeable, you shall go with us. -</p>
               <p>'With all my heart! said mine host - I know 'em all, from the abbot to the junior novice, and will insure you a kind reception.'</p>
               <p>Good again! said I - we could not have lighted upon a better companion - on a more intelligent guide.</p>
               
            <pb n="100" xml:id="pb-100" facs="#i100"/>
               <p>In the way to ALOST, the convent of MELLE stood so invitingly by the way-side; and recollecting the fatal ambuscade mentioned in a former chapter, I could not, with all my haste to get to NINOVE, forbear calling to our coachman to stop.</p>
               <p>We went in, but were disappointed - neither church no cloister has any thing to boast - their best appearance are their outside.</p>
               <p>But the rustic behaviour of the religious was very remarkable, and the strongest instance of impoliteness we experienced in that country. - The fathers turned their backs upon us, and would hardly deign to give us a civil answer; concluding by our habit, as we supposed, that we were English and of course heretics.</p>
               
            <pb n="101" xml:id="pb-101" facs="#i101"/>
               <p>Arriving at ALOST, we found every thing in readiness - the dinner, the carriage, the landlord - and after a short repast we set forward.</p>
               <p>And here it may not be improper to acquaint the reader, with the true character of mine host.</p>
               <p>Don't imagine that Myn Heer COOREMAN (for so he is called) is a meer publican - such a one as is to be met with upon every road in ENGLAND - One, bred a postboy, converted first into an ostler, and afterwards into a tapster: - </p>
               <p>Or, tired out with lazy servitude, now under his late master's escutcheon, reposes his future care in the lap of his once-loved DOLLY - smoaking from morning till night - drinking more than he brews - seldom opening his</p>
               
            <pb n="102" xml:id="pb-102" facs="#i102"/>
               <p>mouth but to swear, and welcome his customers in and out: -</p>
               <p>Or one, whose industry had enabled him to pick up his pence as a marker at a billiard-table: - or whose parts had promoted him, from being a feeder at a cock-pit: -</p>
               <p>Or lastly, from having been formerly the foremost in the Olympic field - and frequently playing booty on all sides; at least confessing himself the rascal but of one, was set up in a first-rate inn, as the reward of his treachery.</p>
               <p>Myn Heer COOREMAN had no such excellencies to boast - he had been simply bred at the university of LOUVAIN - had latin enough to break a thousand charms - had gone through his courses regularly - was as good a polemic as the best of them, and no mean philosopher. - Mine host was</p>
               
            <pb n="103" xml:id="pb-103" facs="#i103"/>
               <p>certainly the most learned and highest bred publican I ever knew, not excepting old KING, at the Angel at OXFORD.</p>
               <p>You see then, discerning reader, by those two instances which I have produced, that mens business is often the effect of accident, not choice.</p>
               <p>The enlightened mind must sometimes stoop for bread, to such employment as the heart ill brooks. -</p>
               <p>One man, without desert, shall have place and distinction; but strip him of the accident of his birth, or partial favour, and he may be found scarce worthy to bear a trencher: - whilst another is fated to draw wine; who notwithstanding may have brains enough to make a bishop'</p>
               
            <pb n="104" xml:id="pb-104" facs="#i104"/>
               <p>Myn Heer COOREMAN, I am perswaded, independent of the chapter of accidents, would have made a better figure in a higher station.</p>
               <p>Let no man then plume himself too much upon his lot in life - upon the accident of his good fortune: - If he is happy, let him study to increase his own happiness and that of others by a course of humility: - If he is simple, let him not offend his neighbours, but labour to conceal his weakness - But if he has understanding, no matter for his situation - he will nevertheless be grateful to heaven that he is not a fool.</p>
               <p>The new abbey of NINOVE, when finished, will be one of the finest, if not the most superb, of any in the NETHERLANDS - the church is already compleated (a magnificent pile! full of</p>
               
            <pb n="105" xml:id="pb-105" facs="#i105"/>
               <p>exquisite ornaments) and the cloister in great fowardness.</p>
               <p>It is really astonishing where those societies find money to carry on such stupendous works! - To re-edify a building at the expence of three or fourscore thousand pounds sterling, without public benefactions, or private donations; but out of the stock of an handful of self-mortifying monks, is such a mystery as a Welch curate would find hard to unriddle; - and in a country too, where there is as deep distress, among the common people, as his own.</p>
               <p>The rule of this abbey if that of St. NORBERT, which seems to be the most opulent order of any in BRABANT - their habit is entirely white (even to their hats when they go out of the cloister) and being tight-bodied, gives</p>
               
            <pb n="106" xml:id="pb-106" facs="#i106"/>
               <p>them the appearance of a company of millers in their holiday-cloaths.</p>
               <p>Thro' the interest of our guide, we might have had any refreshment at this hospitable abbey; and were even invited to sup with the abbot; - an honour which we declined, as the evening threatened darkness, and we had a cross-country road back to ALOST.</p>
               <p>The next morning afforded us the agreeable prospect, of one of the most plentiful and best regulated markets I ever saw.</p>
               <p>The crowd was astonishing and no less the good order - the people were evidently assembled to administer to each others wants - to sell and to buy upon settled marketable terms; without swearing, blaspheming, extorting,</p>
               
            <pb n="107" xml:id="pb-107" facs="#i107"/>
               <p>drinking, abusing and kicking up riots.</p>
               <p>From the variety of necessaries which were there, it had more the appearance of a crouded fair, than of a weekly market.</p>
               <p>That nothing might be wanting to complete the pleasing scene; in one part, you had the eloquent itinerant mountebank and his facetious merry-andrew - In another, a ballad-singer, mounted upon a stool, with a painted shew-cloth, chaunting his tragical ditty, and point out with his want the most affecting passages to his gaping hearers.</p>
               
            <pb n="108" xml:id="pb-108" facs="#i108"/>
               <p>CHAP. XXXI.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER arguments we sound protestants can bring against the monastic institution (and I have no doubt but some of us might produce as many as would decently fill a chapter) I have not yet met with any that have put me out of conceit with the engaging courtesy of some of the brotherhoods - their hospitality to strangers, of what country, or perswasion soever; and their unbounded charity to distressed pilgrims and others.</p>
               <p>By some unaccountable fatality, those primitive virtues stand their ground - and rail at the believer, wrap up in a particular-fashioned habit, as long as we</p>
               <p></p>
               
            <pb n="109" xml:id="pb-109" facs="#i109"/>
               <p>like, we can never strip him of something that lies under it. -</p>
               <p>That by which so many good people are daily benefitted, must needs be praise-worthy - and, indeed, to which, as to articles of faith, we must subscribe whether we will, or no.</p>
               <p>He will not only liberally bestow his alms, but at the same time offer up his prayers for you - the latter you may reject, if you conscience cannot approve: - but surely a good, tho' a mistaken man's blessing, can do no harm.</p>
               <p>In the laboured inventions (for many of them are no more) that have been raised against monks and recluses; you rarely meet with a single favourable circumstance: - all is HYPOCRISY and SPECIOUS ZEAL, the better to carry on the most profligate debaucheries!</p>
               
            <pb n="110" xml:id="pb-110" facs="#i110"/>
               <p>This is generally the language of CONVERTS - and 'tis very fair, according to the true principles of design - for no one would chuse to blazon the good qualities of the character he sought to lessen.</p>
               <p>The more moderate, content themselves with resolving it all into BLINDNESS, and SUPERSTITION, and IGNORANCE! -</p>
               <p>Is that all? - Good heaven help us! - the wisest of us! - Bright goddess! Resplendent TRUTH! - open thou our eyes a little - that we may just catch a glimmering of thy perfection! - enough to guide our stumbling steps! - but not too much! - lest the refulgency prove too strong - too powerful for mortal sight!</p>
               <p>But what of their HOSPITALITY, their CHARITY, Mr. Moderate-man? - Not a syllable.</p>
               
            <pb n="111" xml:id="pb-111" facs="#i111"/>
               <p>Why then, Sir, I am sorry to say, I must exhibit a charge of disingenuity against you - for you certainly would have mentioned somewhat of the one, as well as a great deal of the other, if you had not apprehended it would make against yourself; and have foreseen that it was a salve for a number of sores, and a healing medicine for many mistakes.</p>
               <p>I confess I am fond of prating, especially upon subjects of PHILANTHROPY. - Matters of mystery, I leave to the divines - who so well skilled in expounded? - Words of a doubtful meaning, to philologists - 'tis their diversion - let them sport on: - Matters of contention, to the lawyers - 'tis their bread - I would not rob any man of his bread: - The symptomatic art, with all its qualities and appertenances, the learned faculty of medicine have undoubted right to; and they shall have it untouched for me: - and for the other</p>
               
            <pb n="112" xml:id="pb-112" facs="#i112"/>
               <p>branches of human knowledge, the gentlemen who humourously call themselves PHILOSOPHERS and ADEPTS are at full liberty to divide them.</p>
               <p>Give me only a reasonable portion of PHILANTHROPY! - as much as I can conveniently carry about me, let me travel which way I will, and I am satisfied.</p>
               <p>I abominate incumbrances of every kind - and you see plainly, if I had assumed any other character than that of a well-meaning cosmopolite, that I must have carried my library along with me.</p>
               <p>Meer men of science are positively nothing without their tools.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXII.</p>
               <p>The Traveller visits the Abbey of Affligem.</p>
               <p>SO having settled some few points with myself, such as are hinted at in the preceding chapter; and taken leave of our learned host at the three kings, with a promise never to pass his door in any future Flemish peregrination: - we ordered the coachman to drive to the abbey of AFFLIGEM, about half a league distant from ALOST in the way to BRUSSELS, and about half a mile out of the main road.</p>
               <p>Here the eye of the curious passenger is at once charmed with the delightful situation, the elegant avenue, the universal grandeur! </p>
               
            <pb n="114" xml:id="pb-114" facs="#i114"/>
               <p>if a man, thought I, was ambitious of going to heaven like a gentleman; he need not wish to be transported thither from a more stately terrene mansion!</p>
               <p>To this PALACE of PIETY, princes might retire, after a surfeit of giddy greatness, and quietly lay down their ensigns of human pomp: - sure marks of superior place, but not of more inward peace!</p>
               <p>There's the comfort, after all! - the grand atchievement is to be acquired without them; nor will it have place in any quartering of the laboured escutcheon: -</p>
               <p>What have the parties per pale, the parties per fesse, and the parties per bend of our ancestry to do here? - where each is conscious that he has a serious party per se to act; the record whereof</p>
               
            <pb n="115" xml:id="pb-115" facs="#i115"/>
               <p>is incognizable to, and totally independent of every COURT of HONOUR. - For my part, no offence to the general, nor any man of quality - I hope to be saved!</p>
               <p>The door of HOSPITALITY is ever open - and some of her ministers always upon the watch for the next comer: -</p>
               <p>The modest stranger may spare himself the blush of timidity at this time - let him approach with respectful confidence - my life on't! he will not be rudely interrogated - 'What do you want?' before he is let in; but he will be first admitted: - the pious brethren never doubting, but that some or other of them can administer to his wants, either in matter of beneficence, or courtesy.</p>
               <p>No such question will arise, as - What the devil has brought him hither?'</p>
               
            <pb n="116" xml:id="pb-116" facs="#i116"/>
               <p>- Each has resolved it in his own mind: - Devotion might stimulate - Necessity might urge - Curiosity might prompt. - It may be, to make an offering - to beg an alms - or, to contemplate a passion flower.</p>
               <p>For the love of truth! let us not misreport - neither, for our own sake, let us be unmindful of benefits - from strangers especially; and if of a different communion, so much the more to be admired. -</p>
               <p>It would be the height of ingratitude in me, to pass by the kindnesses of father MARTIN STERCKS, the Hospitalarious of AFFLIGEM; in a work purposely calculated to blazon humanity and to depict men - not to vilify establishments, or bedaub sectaries: - to laugh at those who fancy they are pursuing the old; or hoot at such as are perswaded they have discovered a new road to heaven.</p>
               
            <pb n="117" xml:id="pb-117" facs="#i117"/>
               <p>Having passed through two rooms, and being entered a third, the Hospitalarius, observing my attention was wrapt in a picture of a holy family, addressed me as it were by accident -</p>
               <p>'You are a catholic, sir, said he, I take it for granted?' - (Apparemment, was the word he made use of.)</p>
               <p>No, father, said I, in your sense, I am not. -</p>
               <p>Hence followed a remarkable instance of his politeness - and another of his extensive charity - (such as should make bigots blush, and bridle the tongues of fools!) - For from that moment he never opened his mouth upon the subject of religion; nor could his kindness notwithstanding have been more liberal, even tho' I had been a pope's nephew.</p>
               
            <pb n="118" xml:id="pb-118" facs="#i118"/>
               <p>Having gone thro' the several apartments which are commonly shewn to strangers; he afterwards conducted us to the church. - But it would be an endless task to enumerate the treasures of churches in that country.</p>
               <p>An elaborate collector* has long since filled the greatest part of four volumes in folio, with the trophies of churches in that province only.</p>
               <p>I rather chuse to pause for a moment at this undecorated marble, sacred to the memory of ANTONY SANDERUS, a learned Flemish antiquary of the last century: - who after a life of much labour, falling into distress when most he wanted comfort; found a ready asylum among the pious Benedictines of</p>

               <p>AFFLIGEM; who received him with great kindness, treated him as a brother, made him bless his latter years, and lastly, found room for his bones within the bosom of their sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Soon after, we were ushered into the prior's parlour to dinner (the several principal officers of the abbey being there) by all of whom we were received with much politeness.</p>
               <p>And here give me leave to observe, that if MOTHER-CHURCH has appointed certain days of abstinences; they must be undutiful children indeed, and froward to their own cost, who disobey her commands - <note>Black type</note>Provided always, that in the absence of flesh, they can mortify so luxuriously - upon such excellent fish and fruits as we found among the Benedictines.</p>
               
            <pb n="120" xml:id="pb-120" facs="#i120"/>
               <p>It is very well known to some readers, tho' others are intirely ignorant thereof (to which latter sort I beg leave to address myself) that the several members which compose a religious house, have their respective departments; from the presiding abbot, or prior, to the brother who digs in the garden.</p>
               <p>In abbies, his lordship, or Mr. ABBOT is so much exalted above his fellows, that the domestic oeconomy falls to the prior's and sub-prior's direction; who with their officers, the thesaurarius, or treasurer, who keeps the accounts, receives and pays - the sacrista, who takes care of the church, its ornaments and vestments - the eleemosynarius, or almoner, who looks to the distribution of the alms - the infirmarius, who presides over the infirmary, and visits the sick - the cellarius, who has the charge of the provisions - the hospitalarius,</p>
               
            <pb n="121" xml:id="pb-121" facs="#i121"/>
               <p>who receives the strangers, and keeps up the hospitality of the hosue - the camerarius, or chamberlain, who superintends the apartments - the bibliothecarius, or librarian, who takes upon him to the regulation of the library; with others of a lower order, have all their keys of office.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be wanting in a family so orderly provided - nor any thing neglected, where some one or other has a duty to discharge: - at the same time that the business of the house, are so many relaxations to its members; whilst each is vying with his fellows, who shall best acquit himself of his post.</p>
               <p>I was vastly taken with good father MARTIN's charge; and almost wicked enough to envy him the possession of it - I cannot but account it wickedness, as it certainly is, to envy any</p>
               
            <pb n="122" xml:id="pb-122" facs="#i122"/>
               <p>man the virtuous enjoyment of a pious office. - And, upon second thoughts, I might with as much reason have coveted those of several of his brethren.</p>
               <p>The offices, or acts of MERCY are all in themselves so beautiful - so nearly and intimately allied to kindred dust, that 'tis difficult to fix upon either of them! - Since to give alms to the NEEDY - to feed the HUNGRY - to quench the THIRSTY - to cloath the NAKED - to relieve the CAPTIVE - to visit the SICK - to bury the DEAD; are no less amiable, than to receive the STRANGER.</p>
               <p>Suppose we carry this reflection a little further - and instead of envying this or that pious solitary his particular charge; to consider ourselves as we really are - as members of the great world, and links of general society -</p>
               
            <pb n="123" xml:id="pb-123" facs="#i123"/>
               <p>and, as such, that we have it occasionally in our power to act in each of those heavenly offices! -</p>
               <p>Now what a real object of envy must he be, who can alternately acquit himself of all them!</p>
               <p>If so, my good father STERCKS! long may you enjoy your partial happiness; and worthily fill that office, which no man can discharge with a better grace.</p>
               <p>But give me the various turns in the common changes and chances of mortality! - Enable me this hour to revive the drooping soul - the next, to cheer the comfortless - the next, to rejoice the past-hoping heart! -</p>
               <p>But above all, throw the ACCIDENTAL EVIL in my way, that I may feel</p>
               
            <pb n="124" xml:id="pb-124" facs="#i124"/>
               <p>the unspeakable felicity of doing ACCIDENTAL GOOD! -</p>
               <p>As often as that falls to my lot, I shall rejoice more abundantly; with all the vanity of the creature about me! - firmly perswading myself that I am co-operating with the intentions of PROVIDENCE - which in our weak judgment are ever mysterious - appearing to our short sight, the meer effects of BOUNTEOUS ACCIDENT! </p>
               <p>Lastly, if I am denied the blessing of giving; may I never want the sensations of sympathy! - For to contemplate the condition of others, is the only mean by which I shall arrive at the knowledge of myself.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXIII.</p>
               <p>Journey from Brussels to Louvain.</p>
               <p>WE returned to BRUSSELS the same evening; having withstood an invitation of making a longer stay at the abbey - and the next day, being Sunday, about two in the afternoon, we set forward in the diligence for LOUVAIN.</p>
               <p>That is a manner of travelling which I would recommend to all my itinerant readers: - not because it is the cheapest (a sufficient motive with some) - or the most expeditious; (tho' in that respect 'tis well enough - to do them justice, they keep it up after the rate of about four miles an hour, and are sure to arrive within the time limitted.) - Nor on account of its ease will I recommend it - (that would be to mislead</p>
               
            <pb n="126" xml:id="pb-126" facs="#i126"/>
               <p>them) - for 'tis certainly the most uneasy as well as unsightly vehicle that ever was contrived.</p>
               <p>The one I am speaking of, I judged to be about as long as a broad-wheeled waggon - and its appearance pretty much resembled that machine turned topsy-turvy.</p>
               <p>But what reasonable man, considering himself as he ought to do - as a pilgrim and stranger; would quarrel with the roughness of the way, and the clattering of the wheels upon the pavement for a few hours? - when looking round he may see several happy countenances, in the same situation with himself - and is sure to meet with some, who are both capable and willing to give him all the information he can desire.</p>
               
            <pb n="127" xml:id="pb-127" facs="#i127"/>
               <p>'That is the tower of MECHLIN, which you see at about fifteen miles distance!' - said a reverend jesuit (and shut up his breviary, whilst he was pointing out the beauty of the prospect, which sufficiently displayed itself.)</p>
               <p>I am much obliged to you, father, said I - I fear my curiosity may have interrupted your devotions. - </p>
               <p>'Not at all, sir,' returned the jesuit 'I have time enough for my exercises' - and presently opened his breviary again, and proceeded in silent prayer.</p>
               <p>MONKISH IGNORANCE has been a proverbial expression for several centuries: - they appear to have been no less so in the days of ERASMUS, than they were in the time of CHAUCER - and I am of opinion they are not a jot wiser in our enlightened days.</p>
               
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pb-128" facs="#i128"/>
               <p>I would be understood to speak of the bulk of them - there are hundreds of illustrious examples to the contrary, in all ages and countries. -</p>
               <p>And from what does it proceed think you? - From knowing too little, and believing too much.</p>
               <p>Let any number of prejudiced, half-taught mortals, though of good natural abilities, separate themselves from the world, at any period of life - let them observe a rule for their own government; and thenceforward consider mankind, no further than their little society extends: let them debar themselves the freedom of inquiry - laying down postulates for some things, and taking others for granted: - let them exchange history, for tradition; and modes, for miracles: - My life on't! in less than seven</p>
               
            <pb n="129" xml:id="pb-129" facs="#i129"/>
               <p>years, they may vie with the most unlettered monks.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be a fair deduction of MONKISH IGNORANCE - not that they are composed of more stupid stuff, than the rest of mankind.</p>
               <p>A young bare-footed Carmelite, who sat opposite to me, having indulged me with some particulars relating to his dress, and the austerity of their rule; at last assured me, 'That the habit of their order, was the same in shape and make, in cloth and colour, with that of the prophet ELIJAH, their founder; who had never varied his habit, from the time he was caught up in the fiery chariot, to this day!'</p>
               <p>How! brother, said I - to this day! - Was he not then translated to heaven once for all?</p>
               
            <pb n="130" xml:id="pb-130" facs="#i130"/>
               <p>'No, sir; reply'd the young believer - he is still upon earth - ENOCH and ELIJAH are together - nor will they be translated to the mansions of bliss, 'till the final consummation of all things.'</p>
               <p>This I confess appeared to be strange doctrine - still stranger, that it should be held an article of faith in their society.</p>
               <p>One cannot but admire how they came by such sure, yet imperfect intelligence! - for upon asking him their direction - He told me,</p>
               <p>'He was not certain where they were to be found - God had concealed the place from mortal ken - but that they were unquestionably seated in some terrestrial paradise, prepared on purpose for them.'</p>
               
            <pb n="131" xml:id="pb-131" facs="#i131"/>
               <p>If such articles are admitted into creeds, heaven help the unbelieving!</p>
               <p>We arrived at LOUVAIN, about six in the afternoon; and took up our quarters at the Wild Man (L'Homme Sauvage) opposite the great church - where we found a very obliging host in Myn Heer ADAM, the best entertainment which could be desired.</p>
               <p>The only diversion that evening afforded us, were the joint endeavours of an itinerant empiric, with his party-coloured zany and rope-dancer; - who were exhibiting their mummeries in the market-place by torch-light, to thousands of stupid starers.</p>
               
            <pb n="132" xml:id="pb-132" facs="#i132"/>
               <p>CHAP. XXXIV.</p>
               <p>In Proof that the Traveller made some short Stay at Louvain.</p>
               <p>LOUVAIN, or LOVENS, the mother-city of BRABANT - from its agreeable situation, the salubrity of the air, the great number of ecclesiastic and civil antiquities; its learned societies and plentiful markets; its delightful environs and the courtesy of the inhabitants, cannot but invite the curious passenger to stop a little and look about him.</p>
               <p>But surely it will not be expected I should speak at large upon all these heads; each of which would be sufficient to fill half a dozen chapters? - In that case I shall never get to my journey's end! -</p>
               
            <pb n="133" xml:id="pb-133" facs="#i133"/>
               <p>I rather chuse, in pursuance of my old plan, to touch only upon a few particulars, which happened to catch my eye and imprint some faint images upon my mind; submitting the topographical and historical parts, to be treated at large by future travellers, of more abilities and industry than myself.</p>
               <p>'Tis certainly a most unfair way of proceeding; so to exhaust the subject, as to leave no harvest for others - and now-a-days, when we can fill a handsome folio with the history and antiquities of a second, or third-rate town; in the name of patience! what gleanings shall the poor labourer find? - We must not approach with our sickles for, at least, a century, after such magnanimous reapers.</p>
               <p>Well, they may cut and paste, and write away as fast as they can set pen to</p>
               
            <pb n="134" xml:id="pb-134" facs="#i134"/>
               <p>paper - We're not obliged to read all - that's some comfort,</p>
               <p>Much has been already written of the past; and no doubt, much more might be said of the present state of this celebrated seat of learning; which in number of colleges and students, surpasses both our famous universities. - I cannot precisely determine upon them - some reckon the former at threescore - others say, near fourscore (in which latter computation I apprehend they include the monasteries) - and the number of students is said to be about six thousand. -</p>
               <p>But it falls far short of the first of ours in point of antiquity; and for magnificence cannot be put in competition with either.</p>
               <p>As it happened to be during the vacation when I was there, I had little</p>
               
            <pb n="135" xml:id="pb-135" facs="#i135"/>
               <p>opportunity of information; and daily experience shews us, that the common class of citizens are very deficient in point out, even within their own walls, such things as most excite the curiosity of strangers.</p>
               <p>They must be as visible as St. PETER's* or the STADTHOUSE not to have been overlooked by one half of the inhabitants: - but we may easily spare them then trouble of informing us, that the first is a fine old church, and the latter deservedly numbered among the most beautiful remains of Gothic architecture.</p>
               <p>I am persuaded there are many to be found in all great and populous cities, who never saw their suburbs; nor ever visited any but their own parish</p>
               <p><note>footnote</note>*The great church at LOUVAIN.</p>
               
            <pb n="136" xml:id="pb-136" facs="#i136"/>
               <p>churches: - neither is such supineness in the vulgar to be wondered at; since we frequently meet with men eminently learned in the wisdom of remotest anquity, who are entirely uninterested in the monuments of their own country, and the magnificence of their own time.</p>
               <p>An intimate friend of mine, lately deceased, a man of fortune and of profound erudition, who spent most of his days in LONDON; assured me, not long before his death, he had never seen the inside of St. Paul's Cathedral; though I make no doubt but he must have passed by that superb structure more than a hundred times.</p>
               <p>Another ingenious friend, now living, during two or three years residence in the heart of the city, has never been able to prevail upon himself to penetrate as far as the Tower: -</p>
               
            <pb n="137" xml:id="pb-137" facs="#i137"/>
               <p>The figure then of that royal arsenal with its contents, from whence the most distant shores are armed or intimidated with British thunder, must be unknown to him; nor has he any determinate notion of its situation, more than he has been able to learn from a map.</p>
               <p>Neither of these instances are so singular as they seem at first sight: - We commonly neglect those things that are within our reach - the nearest objects are frequently the farthest from our consideration; and by how much the more interesting they appear, so much the more are they apt to be disregarded.</p>
               <p>The refined classical critic conceives nothing truly so, which is not Greek or Roman - 'It is agreed on all hands, says he, that the middle ages were barbarous; and who so blind</p>
               
            <pb n="138" xml:id="pb-138" facs="#i138"/>
               <p>as not to observe the preposterousness of the present, when compared with the former! -</p>
               <p>'The moderns have neither genius, taste, invention nor workmanship in comparison with the antients: - Vile copiers at best! - Nor have we even such judges of their excellencies as we had heretofore. -</p>
               <p>'The last century indeed produced a plentiful crop of them - the preceding still more: - but in our days of dulness, continues he, I know of none, but - myself, and about half a score select friends.'</p>
               <p>We are running down-hill at the devil of a rate, in the opinions of those gentlemen! - who, unhappily, seldom do any thing themselves to stop our mistaken career! </p>
               
            <pb n="139" xml:id="pb-139" facs="#i139"/>
               <p>he more unintelligible the matter by them to be decyphered, or useless the instruments to be found out; the greater is their glory: and how wide soever they may be of the true meaning; yet no one will dispute the infinite pains they have taken, and the consummate learning they have shewn!</p>
               <p>With what fury will they not wage war in the most distant, barren, lost, or undescried countries, for insignificant trifles! - How intensely hot (as an ingenious modern observes) upon the coldest themes! -</p>
               <p>But where little opposition can be expected, such literary Quixots are pretty sure to carry the field.</p>
               <p>One would be apt to think from the importance of their studies, and no less so of themselves; that schools and seminaries had been founded for no wiser</p>
               
            <pb n="140" xml:id="pb-140" facs="#i140"/>
               <p>purposes, than to fill the present times with learned conjectures upon the past.</p>
               <p>But after all, this vacation had like to have been a terrible stroke upon me!</p>
               <p>Adieu then, said I, to the ceremonials of schools, and the formalities of philosophers! - the pomp of the MAGNIFICENT RECTOR, the prerogative of the chancellor, and the haughtiness of heads of houses! - the pride of professors, the affectation of fellows, and the growing greatness of every puny gownsman! -</p>
               <p>In such season of dissipation, I must have suffered a temporary mortification indeed; had I not previously laid down this principle, the truth of which is confirmed to me by every day's experience - to wit, That, in general, where great learning is, there great ostentation will be also.</p>
               
            <pb n="141" xml:id="pb-141" facs="#i141"/>
               <p>The reader is at liberty to suppose, that the traveller and company ran through several of the colleges, and the schools, upon the best information they could get.</p>
               <p>The university library, which is by very few exceeded, deserves particular mention; - and a few weeks residence there, would have enabled me to give a tolerable account of it.</p>
               <p>The botanical garden, boasts its thousands of native and exotic plants; tho' without the least pretension to grandeur or elegance; nevertheless in the richness of its contents, as I was informed, it may vie with most in EUROPE. - A certain proof that utility is placed in the foremost rank by that illustrious body.</p>
               <p>Being come to the anatomical theatre, it was our good fortune to meet</p>
               
            <pb n="142" xml:id="pb-142" facs="#i142"/>
               <p>with Dr. S-T, the ingenious professor of anatomy and surgery, who was just arrived in town. -</p>
               <p>That gentleman's politeness and affability merits my warmest acknowledgements: and his many curious preparations, are abundant testimonies of his great application and profound skill in his profession.</p>
               <p>But with all my veneration for his character, I could not help observing that, in his demonstrations, he laboured more upon the Minutiae, than the essential parts.</p>
               <p>This, I apprehend, is a common mistake among the learned, as well as the unlearned: and may be thus accounted for - We are too apt to estimate things, in proportion to the trouble they have given us.</p>
               
            <pb n="143" xml:id="pb-143" facs="#i143"/>
               <p>Among other natural curiosities, this theatre exhibits a very extraordinary collection of human cadavers - A whole family of rogues, even to the third generation! - The grandfather, the father, two sons and a daughter! -</p>
               <p>Their crimes are said to have been simple thieving: - the juniors, it seems, as the most active, committed the thefts; and the seniors, as the most experienced, directed, received, and disposed of the same.</p>
               <p>In former times, such a family, however prosperous, was thought a disgrace to any virtuous city: - and here in LOUVAIN, it was judged necessary to break such a knot; and the most effectually, by extirpating them root and branch.</p>
               <p>Four of them were publickly executed; but one of the young men escaped</p>
               
            <pb n="144" xml:id="pb-144" facs="#i144"/>
               <p>the halter, by dying in prison: - But that the memory of is iniquity might not perish, it was thought fit to add his carcase to the rest; that even in death they might not be divided.</p>
               <p>They are said to have made a part of the university museum for about three hundred years! during which time they have suffered less change, save in colour, than could have been expected; their features being pretty entire and distinguishable at this day.</p>
               <p>CHAP. XXXV.</p>
               <p>A few more particulars concerning Louvain and its Environs.</p>
               <p>'TRAVELLERS, I have observed, said Mr. SOMEBODY, seldom content their readers.' -</p>
               
            <pb n="145" xml:id="pb-145" facs="#i145"/>
               <p>And yet every body reads us, said I.</p>
               <p>''Tis very rare that you meet with what you wanted to find.'</p>
               <p>How do I know what you are looking for?</p>
               <p>'They are either too classical' -</p>
               <p>You are unclassical -</p>
               <p>- 'Or too illiterate.'</p>
               <p>You are too classical.</p>
               <p>'They are tedious' -</p>
               <p>You are trifling -</p>
               <p>- 'Or they are impertinent.'</p>
               <p>You are dull.</p>
               <p>'They are critical' -</p>
               <p>You are finical -</p>

               <p>- 'Or they are whimsical.'</p>
               <p>You are cynical.</p>
               <p>The fault will always lie on your side, take my word for't.</p>
               <p>In short, Mr. SOMEBODY, as long as there are men, there will be a variety of tastes, of books, of readers: - and shall not I have my share of the latter? presumes every modest author: - since the worst of us, write as well as we can; and the best of you, judge only as you care capable.</p>
               <p>But you sha'n't put me out of conceit with my endeavours to please the public, before I have hazarded their smiles; nor will I anticipate the mortification of having taken so much pains to no purpose.</p>
               <p>I generally made it a rule to visit my fair countrywomen wherever I</p>

               <p>Finding there were two English sisterhoods at LOUVAIN, of the highest and the lowest orders - the happiest and the most unhappy! (if chearful plenteousness is blessing, and meagre want and baleful melancholy a curse!) - the richest and the wretchedest tenants which that fair city boasts! - I could not resist the painful curiosity of seeing them.</p>
               <p>That of the Canonesses, is reckoned the most opulent English house in the NETHERLANDS - that of the Theresians the poorest and most pitiable!</p>
               <p>Report speaks highly of, and perhaps may exaggerate, the riches of the former; tho' appearances in every respect</p>

               <p>confirm the received opinion. - The great number of monumental inscriptions in their chapel, shew that some of the first English catholic families have been of their order, or nearly allied to those who were.</p>
               <p>I had the pleasure of conversing with the lady prioress and some of her sister nuns, for about a quarter of an hour; and am now fully perswaded that by custom and society we may overcome many difficulties, which at first sight appear to be insuperable.</p>
               <p>Confinement, which is certainly among the greatest, wears off of itself; and to the habit of women, which is more sedentary than ours, not so irreconcilable as we may imagine.</p>
               <p>However, I would not be thought an advocate for that pernicious practice; nor should any consideration</p>
               
            <pb n="149" xml:id="pb-149" facs="#i149"/>
               <p>upon earth, bribe me to make a wilful sacrifice of a daughter, a sister, or a niece, in the prime of life, to such unnatural love.</p>
               <p>Now if affluence and the most refined female conversation, ought not to bewitch our daughters into this hateful celibacy - tell me, ye chaste stars! what could tempt the unerring virgin to associate with such melancholy spectres as these poor Theresians?</p>
               <p>These indeed shew the steep and thorny way to heaven! - a road which nature shudders at! - nor ever could have been pointed out by him, whose service is perfect freedom - whose yoke is easy, and whose burden light!</p>
               <p>After all, were it not for the churches and monasteries, I have often thought that many of my countrymen must pass their hours but dully, amidst</p>

               <p>the solemn stillness of LOUVAIN; in vacation-time more especially.</p>
               <p>I would therefore advise such as have but little taste for paintings, still less for ceremonies; and that regard societies who have cut themselves off from the commerce of the gay and busy world, as being no longer any part of the world; not to squander their precious moments here; but to order post-horses immediately, and make the best of their way to SPA.</p>
               <p>One might naturally have expected to have found some further entertainment among the shops of booksellers, in so eminent an university. - Nothing, upon my reputation! but civil and canon law, and school-divinity. - I am obliged to you, Myn Heer VAN OVERBEEK, said I; but those wont's do for Englishmen and protestants.</p>

               <p>Our most distinguished walks were to Heverle castle, belonging to the duke D'AREMBERG, the convent of Celestines, in the same neighbourhood, and to the Norbetine abbey of PARC - the most distant being within two miles of the city.</p>
               <p>By the favour of his grace's steward we were admitted into the castle, and saw all that remains of that stately building - The greatest part having been consumed by fire a few years ago, the remainder has been lately converted into a hunting seat. - The principal front however escaped the flames, and by contracting the apartments, there are still lodgings for two or three hundred people.</p>
               <p>But that lord who boasts so many castles.* may easily bear the curtailing</p>

               <p>of one; if his philosophy keeps pace, as it is presumed it does, with the rest of his princely virtues.</p>
               <p>The convent of Celestines, founded by one of the DE CROY's, duke of ARSCHOT (but whether by WILLIAM, sirnamed the Wise; the governor and chief favourite of the emperor CHARLES V. I will not take upon me to determine) seems to be much upon the decline: - Its antient splendor is worn out - its former magnificence become rusty: - there is an appearance of premature ruin, from the want of necessary repair and beautifying.</p>
               <p>That same WILLIAM, I well remember, stands charged in history with insatiable avarice. - Can it be then that his piety raised a superstructure, which his parsimony would not suffer him to have upheld? - 'Tis possible; - and</p>
               
            <pb n="153" xml:id="pb-153" facs="#i153"/>
               <p>yet, methinks, the church is of an earlier date.</p>
               <p>But piety is not the only motive for erecting churches - funebrial pomp may also have a share; they serving for the most part as mausoleums of their founders; - as in the one before us, where many of that princely family, descended from the antient kings of HUNGARY, sleep with their faces upwards, in all the pride of sculpture.</p>
               <p>Here a reverend hoary-headed monk, with standing tears of tenderest compassion in his eyes, importuned me much concerning the disposition of our KING; particularly towards the roman catholics: - and seemed perfectly easy, when I assured him, That the HEART of our present SOVEREIGN WAS HUMANITY itself! - and</p>
               
            <pb n="154" xml:id="pb-154" facs="#i154"/>
               <p>that persecution for conscience sake, was no doctrine of the church of ENGLAND.</p>
               <p>I shall say little of the abbey of PARC, having already spoken of the one at NINOVE, of the same order - but cannot help remarking, that its situation is delightful, and its buildings magnificent. - Those who are fond of painted glass, which is a favourite object of mine, will find a very beautiful collection in the cloister of that abbey; representing the life of St. NORBERT, their founder.</p>
               <p>Before I quit LOUVAIN, I beg leave to add that the Wednesday's market (notwithstanding vacation) furnished as great a prospect of plenty, as I remember to have seen any where. - Flesh, fowl, fish, fruits - Game in great abundance - Toys and trinkets</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXVI.</p>
               <p>An Apology for Wooden Shoes.</p>
               <p>'HAVE a care! Mr. Traveller - for now thou'rt on a precipice, from whence 'tis odds if thou escapest!' -</p>
               <p>Where's the danger?</p>
               <p>'O thou purblind pilgrim! - to whom art thou writing?'</p>
               <p>To men.</p>
               <p>'Insensible to the last degree! - he understands me not!</p>
               <p>'Are they not Britons, and art not thou a Briton? - What then can they have to do with the subject of this</p>
               
            <pb n="157" xml:id="pb-157" facs="#i157"/>
               <p>chapter? - a subject which every free-born Briton holds in just derision, contempt, abhorrence!'</p>
               <p>Away with such impertinence! and let me cheapen this honest man's wooden shoes. - How much a pair friend?</p>
               <p>"What sort? what size?"</p>
               <p>O, all sorts and sizes, fro the pigmie to the colossian - You seem to have a fine parcel!</p>
               <p>"Yes, Heaven be praised! there's no want of shoes in this country."</p>
               <p>Such as they are. -</p>
               <p>"I believe no place affords better, nor cheaper - from two-pence to seven-pence a pair."</p>
               
            <pb n="158" xml:id="pb-158" facs="#i158"/>
               <p>And pray now, honest friend, can people walk with them?</p>
               <p>"Was there ever such a foolish question? - why don't you see thousands in the market who wear no other? - Walk with them, quotha! - ay, and run with them, and dance with them too!"</p>
               <p>Are they warm?</p>
               <p>"Far more so than yours."</p>
               <p>Are they light?</p>
               <p>"Much lighter, I'm told, than ploughmen's shoes in ENGLAND, and full as pliant."</p>
               <p>Are they lasting?</p>
               <p>"You cannot easily wear them out; - only keep them from breaking, and they will last a long while."</p>
               
            <pb n="159" xml:id="pb-159" facs="#i159"/>
               <p>What a comfort and blessing to the poor! -</p>
               <p>'The comfort of wooden shoes? ridiculous! - What a blessing to the poor? - I shall burst with indignation! - Will you not give over yet?' -</p>
               <p>Let me see! - why then for about half a crown, a man may shoe himself, his wife, and half a dozen sturdy children for several months together -</p>
               <p>'May trammel them! may fetter them! you mean' -</p>
               <p>How can that be? when you hear they can dance in them -</p>
               <p>'And so they might in chains! - and where's the difference?'</p>
               <p>The difference is obvious in my sense - the one implies restraint from a forfeiture</p>
               
            <pb n="160" xml:id="pb-160" facs="#i160"/>
               <p>of liberty; the other shews freedom and protection.</p>
               <p>'Freedom in wooden shoes? - preposterous!'</p>
               <p>As preposterous as it may appear to you, I think it very evident that these people are free to wear others whenever they can afford it: - In the mean time they are protected from the common injuries, which I should suppose attends bare-footed poverty; and are more capable of labour, than if they wore shammy, or dog-skin. - Use makes them full as easy, and the small expence brings them within the compas of the poor husbandman.</p>
               <p>Humanity pleads strongly in their favour; and reproaches us with having a more tender concern for our cattle, than for many of our own species; since horses, oxen and even asses that</p>
               
            <pb n="161" xml:id="pb-161" facs="#i161"/>
               <p>labour are taken care of in that regard; the worth of the beast, depending in a great measure, upon the preservation of its feet. -</p>
               <p>'But what has this to do with BRITAIN?'</p>
               <p>Your pardon - it has to do with BRITAIN, or i should not have introduced it.</p>
               <p>'The man is absolutely mad!'</p>
               <p>I am not mad, though you are ignorant; and a stranger even in your own country -</p>
               <p>Know then, that in the northern part of this loved island, where property is so partially divided that all are lords, or beggars; shoes are almost as scarce as parishes: - at least one may venture to affirm that in many, nineteen go</p>
               
            <pb n="162" xml:id="pb-162" facs="#i162"/>
               <p>bare-footed, for one who is well shod: and even i ntheir august capital and gallant port of LEITH, the number of wretched Carmelites which are to be seen is piteous, is shocking!</p>
               <p>Would it not therefore be an act of greatest charity! -</p>
               <p>'Would you sow sedition among them?' -</p>
               <p>By introducing shoes?</p>
               <p>'You'd raise another rebellion!'</p>
               <p>By giving them shoes?</p>
               <p>'Will you still insist upon it?'</p>
               <p>I don't insist upon any thing: - I would only insinuate that, according to my judgment - wooden shoes are better than no shoes at all.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XXXVII.</p>
               <p>Of assumed Characters and Sham-Titles.</p>
               <p>WHAT shall I say of the water-passage from LOUVAIN to MECHLIN, ore than I have already said of those between OSTENDE and BRUGES; and BRUGES and GHENT? - which is, that to such as perfectly consult their ease, 'tis the most delightful way of travelling in the world.</p>
               <p>Now to the subject of my chapter -</p>
               <p>Nothing gives me greater disgust than assumed characters, sham titles, and, in fine, every species of false appearance.</p>
               <p>I hinted somewhat of this in one of my chapters of BRUSSELS; and here,</p>
               
            <pb n="164" xml:id="pb-164" facs="#i164"/>
               <p>in the LOUVAIN-barge I have met with fresh cause to vent my spleen.</p>
               <p>So particularly nice am I in this respect, that I can hardly bear a cheese-monger's laced hat upon a Sunday! - but a ship-chandler's bag-wig and sword at Redriff-assembly, are my aversion! -</p>
               <p>If an inn-keeper chuses to keep a stud; he has my free leave - 'tis no way out of character - he may profit by it in a double sense, and learn to make matches, as well as reckonings:</p>
               <p>His customers approve of it, and call him a clever fellow for his pains - he may come in time to be a worthy member of the Jockey-Club.</p>
               <p>So if a pickpocket noses a peer upon the turf, with, 'Six to four ughin your lordship, and I say done first!' -</p>
               
            <pb n="165" xml:id="pb-165" facs="#i165"/>
               <p>What's that to me, if his lordship takes no offence? -</p>
               <p>But upon the ruffian's success in his bet, and his roaring out 'Mine, by G-d! - There! there! there! - my lord! my lord! my lord!' - in the same unmannerly tone, as if the scoundrel was hooting deformity - that I approve of: - 'Tis an admirable lesson! - and his lordship may be, in consequence, sooner or later, more choice of his company.</p>
               <p>But if peers will occasionally mix with pickpockets; no wonder that pickpockets endeavour sometimes to pass for peers.</p>
               <p>'Pray, sir,' said father LUCIANUS of OUDENARDE to me, as we were standing upon the deck, and were got about half way on our passage from LOUVAIN to MECHLIN -</p>
               
            <pb n="166" xml:id="pb-166" facs="#i166"/>
               <p>We had been talking together about a variety of other things below in the cabin, in concert with another Capucin. -</p>
               <p>This father LUCIANUS appeared to me to be a plain simple monk; and therefore most liable to be imposed upon. -</p>
               <p>When I say simple, I would be understood in the primitive sense of the word - I mean the simplicity of his heart; for that was as evident, as were the roughness of his cheeks, the bushyness of his beard, and the prominency of his paunch.</p>
               <p>'Pray, said father LUCIANUS, are you acquainted with my lord P-?'</p>
               <p>My lord P-! said I, recollecting myself - there is no such lord.</p>
               
            <pb n="167" xml:id="pb-167" facs="#i167"/>
               <p>'Indeed but there is!' said the father.</p>
               <p>Indeed but there is not! said I - Capucins carry no money, or we should certainly have had a bet upon it.</p>
               <p>'There may be such a lord, said the father, and you not know it.' -</p>
               <p>That I deny, was my answer. - What sort of a man is he?</p>
               <p>'Why he is' - and so described him.</p>
               <p>I have heard so much of that person formerly, said I, that I bless my stars I am not acquainted with him! - but the latter part I muttered to myself, as unwilling to give offence.</p>
               <p>'And is he not an English lord?' said the father.</p>
               
            <pb n="168" xml:id="pb-168" facs="#i168"/>
               <p>He an English lord! said I - (turning my face aside, that he might not perceive the sneer upon it)</p>
               <p>'What, not an English peer?' said the Monk. -</p>
               <p>He an English peer! said I, with marks of detestation in my countenance - for I could no longer contain myself! - I could find out, thought I, three or four titles, and each beginning with a P, that would suit his sham-excellence far better than that which he has assumed.</p>
               <p>'Once for all, said the father, he is a lord, as sure as you are gentleman!'</p>
               <p>Once for all, returned I, he is no more a peer, than you r reverence is a Pope! - I will appeal to that gentleman - (pointing to a man of fashion who</p>
               
            <pb n="169" xml:id="pb-169" facs="#i169"/>
               <p>was sitting in the steerage) who from his rank in life and residence in this part of the country, may be presumed to be better judge of living characters, than your reverences, who profess to have abandoned the world.</p>
               <p>'With all my heart!' said father LUCIANUS.</p>
               <p>We appeared before the arbiter; who pronounced his judgment in these remarkable words -</p>
               <p><note>French</note>'Monsieur P - un milord? - Par D-! Illui manque bien quatre pouces de hauteur d'un milord Anglois!'</p>
               <p>Is your reverence satisfied?</p>
               <p>'I am, said he - mais, cependant, c'est un brave homme.'</p>
               
            <pb n="170" xml:id="pb-170" facs="#i170"/>
               <p>Having got rid of this dirty subject, the good father and I, with his brother Monk, jogged on very sociably to MECHLIN, talking upon different matters.</p>
               <p>Before we parted, which was at the gate of the Capucins convent, he invited my companion and me to breakfast there the next morning - 'and tho' he was but a visitor, he assured us, the superior would make us very welcome.' - His invitation was acceptable. -</p>
               <p>Here we exchanged bows and benedicites with the good fathers! - and betook ourselves to our inn, the St. JAMES, or pilgrim*, int he corn-market.</p>

               <p>The Traveller breakfast with the Capucins of Mechlin.</p>
               <p>MY companion and I were true to our appointment at the Capucins convent at breakfast.</p>
               <p>Seven in the morning was the hour. - Upon my word! an early breakfasting hour at the latter end of the month of September.</p>
               <p>Yet those who are beforehand with the lark, in blessing the rising day! - who shakes off sleep, 'ere vain and busy worldings go to slumber! - who patiently endure all wants, yet suffer none! - who rise at midnight to chaunt their Maker's praise; and piously place to the account of an all-gracious and</p>

               <p>all-merciful Being, those stripes which they inflict upon themselves! - may surely be indulged in a light breakfast at seven, without any reflection upon their rule.</p>
               <p>They shall never be charged with voluptuousness by me, for quenching their thirty throats with a few dishes of weak tea - sweetened with a little limp of sugar-candy, so tenacious as not to be totally dissolves in the first, second, or third cup - and this served in the plainest manner without cream, or milk, or the smallest particle to eat! -</p>
               <p>For Heaven's sake! what would you desire less to support the human frame?</p>
               <p>My companion stared! - and well he might, for he had never been in such company before: - they looked formidable enough in the street, in his eyes;</p>

               <p>- and let me tell you, to be shut up in a room with ten, or a dozen of them, for the first time, is no agreeable novelty.</p>
               <p>To the superstitiously-zealous in their own way, they would shew like a company of saints - to the timidly-superstitious in another, they would seem a company of necromancers - but to the liberal-minded, devoid of either superstition, they must appear like a company of madmen.</p>
               <p>I confess I could not help looking round me several times - but from a meer carnal motive: - It was to satisfy myself from what quarter the bread and butter was to come. -</p>
               <p>From no quarter at all: - so we supt up our tea and returned thanks to father guardian for his kind entertainment.</p>

               <p>Father BONAVENTURE, the superior, or guardian as he is called (and one of the most exemplary characters alive, if report speaks truth of him) entertained us with a degree of partiality to our country; in grateful remembrance of kindnesses, which he had received from several of our countrymen; in particular from Sir J- P-, the late British minister at BRUSSELS; the father himself, as he informed us, residing there at that time: - as also because he had some knowledge of the English tongue.</p>
               <p>I understood he was a man of fashion; and indeed his manners in every respect confirmed it.*</p>
               <p><note>footnote</note>*Men of the highest quality, and even princes of the blood-royal, have occasionally degraded themselves to this humblest order of christian philosophers.</p>
               
            <pb n="175" xml:id="pb-175" facs="#i175"/>
               <p>His first application to our language, was for the spiritual comfort of a poor dying English catholic solider, who could not depart in peace without confession; and there was no confessor in the place but himself.</p>
               <p>He attempted and succeeded sufficiently in a short time.</p>
               <p>You are to understand, that the capucins are the only champions in the day of desolation! - When death deals his wrath upon thousands, within the compas of a few hours!</p>
               <p>All other orders dread the din of war; and fly, like seculars, with laic cowardice, the rot of pestilence and the rage of famine! - These nobly brave the field, for the souls-sake of those that remain behind; survive the visitation, or perish in their duty!</p>
               
            <pb n="176" xml:id="pb-176" facs="#i176"/>
               <p>This is a true character of the capucins - who are also indefatigable in preaching, in visiting the sick, and other acts of mercy; and who attend to more confessions than all the rest of the societies put together.</p>
               <p>This naturally begets in the populace a great veneration for their order; by whom they are justly esteemed, with respect to others, the FORLORN-HOPE of the CHURCH MILITANT.</p>
               <p>Our breakfast with the Capucins, before recited, together with a good dinner at the ordinary, enabled us to pass a very comfortable day at MECHLIN - one of the politest, the neatest and most agreeable cities in the NETHERLANDS.</p>   
            <pb n="177" xml:id="pb-177" facs="#i177"/>
               <p>CHAP. XXXIX.</p>
               <p>A very singular Character.</p>
               <p>THOSE who from their situation and inability, cannot promote the cause of VIRTUE in any eminent degree; may in some measure serve it, by reciting the examples of others; and trumpeting the praises of her more elevated votaries.</p>
               <p>No matter in what sphere they shine, what stations they dignify, or what communion they grace.</p>
               <p>TRANSCENDANT VIRTUE is exalted far above external pomp, and rite, and custom! - and smiles indignant at all the vulgar distinctions of Jew and Gentile; Greek and Turk; Roman</p>
               
            <pb n="178" xml:id="pb-178" facs="#i178"/>
               <p>and Briton; Jesuit and Jansenist; High-Churchman and Quaker.</p>
               <p>And so much by way of prologue, or apology for the sketch which I am going to give of the present archbishop of MECHLIN and abbot of AFFLIGEM - The BENSON,* or BUTLERâ  <note>CROSS</note> of the NETHERLANDS! - A prince of most amiable qualities, befitting any high station; but more particularly and happily adapted to that which he now fills.</p>
               <p>I had taken a good deal of notice of his picture, which is hung up in the refectory of the monks of AFFLIGEM, and was much pleased with the resemblance - a countenance, more inclined to the melancholy than the sanguine - a cast of feature, not unlike that of our</p>

               <p>great BOYLE, which is a favorite portrait of mine, and one which I think cannot be consider'd, without concluding that he who sat for it must have been a good man.</p>
               <p>This upright arch-prelate, they say, is of opinion, that his greatness is no exemption to him from exercising the rites of his sacred function; and is so far from shutting himself up within the narrow confine of a fancied self-importance; like a singular cross, or any other choice spectacle, which is only to be exhibited upon certain high-days and holidays; that he is continually employed in acts of devotion and munificence; of humility and free communication; in admonishing his clergy, for their own honour, and for the good of those who are entrusted to their care; in visiting the monks of his abbey, or the poor capucins of</p>
               
            <pb n="180" xml:id="pb-180" facs="#i180"/>
               <p>MECHLIN, in whose fruit and kitchen-garden he finds more solace, than in his own lawns and parterres.</p>
               <p>By every individual in his diocese, he is reverenced as their one pastor and father; and revered as their common friend and benefactor.</p>
               <p>To every citizen of MECHLIN he is not only personally known, but intimately acquainted with the condition and circumstances of the family - can call the poorest man by his name, and enquire after his wife MARY, and his son PETER.</p>
               <p>Four times a year he visits the poor and the helpless; the lame and the blind; and administers the sacrament to each in their several hovels, or garrets with his own hand.</p>
               
            <pb n="181" xml:id="pb-181" facs="#i181"/>
               <p>This last instance of his extensive charity might be very easily dispensed with - but it seems, as yet, he has not been able to dispense with it himself.</p>
               <p>This excellent person, as I am informed, is not yet forty years of age - he is by birth, a German, and by quality, a count; but I have forgot the name of his house.</p>
               <p>Can it be wondered that such a prince of bishops should be universally admired, beloved! - and would it not be almost pardonable, if some estates of human ignorance, should sink into an idolatrous worship of such a character?</p>
               <p>But I beg pardon - 'For what? - Where's the offence?'</p>
               
            <pb n="182" xml:id="pb-182" facs="#i182"/>
               <p>I own 'tis a favourite topic, and might be enlarged - but since only a slight sketch was proposed - by which I hope the reader may so far profit, as to be satisfied that the brightest examples of primitive virtue are still to be seen, even in this degenerate age, if people will but take the pains to look about 'em.</p>
               <p>Blush! pluralists, blush! - Ye who have already larger flocks than ye can tend! -</p>
               <p>But what's that to me? - I'll stick to my drawing.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XL.</p>
               <p>Containing some Mortifications which the Traveller underwent, in his Journey to and upon his Arrival at Antwerp - with unexpected Reflections.</p>
               <p>WE proceeded from MECHLIN to ANTWERP in the diligence -</p>
               <p>But therein, our attention to the pleasant rout, as well as to the rest of the company, was much interrupted by the most impertinent itinerant jackanapes I ever met with! - who called himself a doctor.</p>
               <p>A doctor quotha! - the devil take such doctors!</p>
               <p>Yes, a doctor! - and sworn physician (as he informed us) to most of the sovereign princes in Europe! -</p>
               
            <pb n="184" xml:id="pb-184" facs="#i184"/>
               <p>They must be the crowned heads of a royal collection of wax-work then, thought I to myself.</p>
               <p>Nothing could stand in competition with that fellow's impudence, but his ignorance; nor any thing match his ignorance, but his impudence.</p>
               <p>He had a smattering of many tongues, but no language - a title to several cities, but no one would have owned him - an affection of many characters, in the variety of which he had lost his own.</p>
               <p>He would sing, without being intreated - and laugh, till he cracked the drum of your ear - and tell stories, till you wished him dumb.</p>
               <p>In his short intervals of sleep, his snoring was hideous - yet you could not but dread his waking, from the</p>
               
            <pb n="185" xml:id="pb-185" facs="#i185"/>
               <p>apprehension of being poisoned by his beastly belchings,</p>
               <p>If he had nay pretension to humour, it was in taking off the mendicant preachers - but even there his irreverence shocked, more than his mimickry pleased: - and his unseasonable jests upon fortuitous, or voluntary poverty clearly evinced, that human misery was the prime object of his mirth.</p>
               <p>His true character, I am fully perswaded, was that of a conjuring, leger-demain quack - one who dispenses his drops and his salves to the gaping multitude in the morning, and shews his hocus-pocus tricks, and plays his puppets to them in the evening.</p>
               <p>But there was no possibility of getting rid of him - we were therefore constrained to suffer his nauseous company till we got to ANTWERP.</p>
               
            <pb n="186" xml:id="pb-186" facs="#i186"/>
               <p>Here a far greater mortification succeeded - for upon our arrival at that stately city, my friend and fellow pilgrim; the polite companion of my journey from LONDON, and hitherto the pleasing associate in all my FLEMISH occurrences, declared to me his intention of returning in the most expeditious manner.</p>
               <p>'My time is expired, my dear CORIAT! said he, and my affairs call me home: - But I would have you proceed a little further in your ingenious remarks.</p>
               <p>'When you return, to rejoice me, with the rest of your friends, I must intreat you to recollect the most material - and if you can find such a thing as an honest bookseller, my advice will be to publish them by all means. - For however ungratefully the present age may requite such services; who knows but</p>
               
            <pb n="187" xml:id="pb-187" facs="#i187"/>
               <p>that posterity may thankfully accept them, and raise a pillar of affection to the pious author.'</p>
               <p>So saying, he began to prepare for his journey back to ENGLAND, by the way of ROTTERDAM.</p>
               <p>It would have been fruitless to have attempted to alter his resolution, which I knew to be fixed.</p>
               <p>He had already exceeded the limitation of absence, which he had set himself beforehand: and if he was all along silent upon that head, it was because he would not lessen the pleasure which he was sensible I enjoy, till within a few hours of his departure.</p>
               <p>His consideration, you find, was great, tho' his resolves were absolute.</p>
               
            <pb n="188" xml:id="pb-188" facs="#i188"/>
               <p>His curiosity was at least equal to mine; but he knew better how far it ought to be indulged.</p>
               <p>Had I vainly conceited I had more fire than my companion; it was also evident to me he had more fortitude.</p>
               <p>Admitting I had now and then expressed more fancy; yet how insignificant was that, compared with the superior firmness of mind, which he had shewn upon every occasion?</p>
               <p>Two days after, my kind companion, my constant friend, who had equally doubled the pleasure, and diminished the toil of my travel - left me. -</p>
               <p>We had been ever of one mind, during our short peregrination - of dispositions happily suited to each other - alike conformable to ourselves and to strangers - alike pleased and displeased, with objects of delight and disgust. -</p>
               
            <pb n="189" xml:id="pb-189" facs="#i189"/>
               <p>Two days after, he left me! - I have now lost one half of myself! said I.</p>
               <p>These little anecdotes of private friendship, however uninteresting to the generality, may nevertheless have a sensible influence upon some future itinerant companions.</p>
               <p>They may call to their remembrance the advice of the patriarch, to his departing brethren - See that ye fall not out by the way!</p>
               <p>CHAP. XLI.</p>
               <p>An Instance of the wonderful Efficacy of Ceremonies; with other Matters no less worthy.</p>
               <p>MY friend had left me at a time when, for his own sake, I desired his company most - for he had never seen any grand annual procession;</p>
               
            <pb n="190" xml:id="pb-190" facs="#i190"/>
               <p>and the day following produced a very remarkable one - commemorating a fatal aera indeed! - namely, that of the SWEATING-SICKNESS - which formerly raged with great violence in BRABANT, as well as in other regions: - But by the seasonable application of processions and other church-ceremonies, as it is recorded, the plague ceased.</p>
               <p>About one third of the inhabitants of ANTWERP assisted at the solemnity - the rest were admiring spectators.</p>
               <p>The religious orders, with their particular banners; the trades, with their several pageants and chaplains at their heads; the magistrates, with their ensigns of authority; the secular clergy, still nearest to the throne of grace; the high-priest for the day, bearing the transubstantiated wafer - the whole interspersed with a great number of volunteer taper-bearers - and lastly, the</p>
               
            <pb n="191" xml:id="pb-191" facs="#i191"/>
               <p>penitents, who closed the solemn parade.</p>
               <p>After high mass in the great church, the regulars were marshalled in the choir, from whence the procession issued, and in slow march made a circuit of a great part of the city, during two hours.</p>
               <p>But one ridiculous circumstance fell out; which hardly any body there could be struck with but myself -</p>
               <p>You must known that the music of bells in that country, is not effected by the vulgar tintinnabular art of pulling ropes; but they are played upon by musical bellman - One of whom I thought a little unfortunate in his choice on so solemn an occasion - Would you believe it? - the chosen air from a certain steeple, was a celebrated English hornpipe!</p>
               
            <pb n="192" xml:id="pb-192" facs="#i192"/>
               <p>It would have been highly unseasonable at such a time, either to have indulged mirth, or to have fallen a dancing; tho' there was sufficient provocation for both: - I could hardly keep my feet still - and I could hardly forbear laughing.</p>
               <p>The mixture of serious and farce in ceremonies, might well be wondered at; was it not uniformly kept up in private life and conversation among bigots. - In one of the nuns gardens at ANTWERP, i remember to have met with statues of saints, and statues of scaramouches.</p>
               <p>With what reverence, and at the same time how irreverently some ignorant bigots treat the most exalted subjects!</p>
               <p>I met with one instance which may serve my purpose as well as a hundred.</p>
               
            <pb n="193" xml:id="pb-193" facs="#i193"/>
               <p>- For the lowness of the matter, I am almost ashamed to give it place; and yet in proof, I could not wish to have a stronger.</p>
               <p>Walking one day in the Dominicans Calvary at ANTWERP, which is visited by all strangers and frequently by many devotees - a small consecrated spot set apart for divine love and purest contemplation - to inflame the mind with the memory of the chosen servants of God; patriarchs, prophets and apostles - whose numerous statues, executed by the first sculptors of this country, croud the little inclosure - but more especially to beget a reverential awe for the sufferings of the Son of Man, who is there exalted upon the cross - Death and Hell being beneath him! - Here's room for meditation! -</p>
               <p>I say walking there one day - three of the queen's soldiers entered, who</p>
               
            <pb n="194" xml:id="pb-194" facs="#i194"/>
               <p>behaved with much decency, as they generally do.</p>
               <p>These men having put up their petitions, seemingly with great fervency, rose from their knees, and began to look critically about them.</p>
               <p>They spoke French. - One of them who had travelled farther than his companions (who were wrapt in admiration of the place) acknowledged it to be very fine, but not to be compared with the calvary at PRAGUE which he had seen.</p>
               <p>Alas! how poor are seemingly great things by comparison!</p>
               <p>'Is the calvary at PRAGUE so much finer?' said the other.</p>
               <p>Par D-! reply'd the first, <note>French</note>il se fou-t bien le pied au cul de celui la!</p>
               
            <pb n="195" xml:id="pb-195" facs="#i195"/>
               <p>An English, or an Irish catholic soldier who had seen both, in running the comparison, would have said, beats his a-e off.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the feast of St. MICHAEL, was a gala day indeed, at the Norbertine abbey dedicated to that saint. - Here the abbot assisted at high mass, in more than princely magnificence!</p>
               <p>How paultry are civil rites, when put in competition with church ceremonies! - What pitiful things are thrones, compared with altars! -</p>
               <p>The greatest being on this side heaven, in my poor persuasion, is a pope, a cardinal, a bishop, or a mitred abbot in his pontificalibus!</p>
               <p>There were other high festivals at ANTWERP during my sojourn there;</p>
               
            <pb n="196" xml:id="pb-196" facs="#i196"/>
               <p>particularly those of St. FRANCIS and the blessed Rosary - the former sacred to the numerous orders who claim a merit in that holy hermit - the latter a day of much exultation among the Dominicans, as having been instituted by St. DOMINIC their founder.</p>
               <p>But although I was present at those solemnities, yet I purposely avoid particularizing them - lest it might be expected I should set them in a ridiculous light, for the diversion of one part of my christian readers; and because I am aware it would be no less a mortification to another part of them. -</p>
               <p>Neither do I find myself disposed, at this time, to be over and above ludicrous upon so serious a concern, as that on which thousands of well-meaning mortals rest their everlasting welfare.</p>
               
            <pb n="197" xml:id="pb-197" facs="#i197"/>
               <p>I have simply attempted to make mankind better: however weak my efforts to that end - but I shall not endeavour to make them less superstitious - that were a weak attempt indeed!</p>
               <p>CHAP. XLII.</p>
               <p>Which to some mawkish Readers will appear full of Insipidity.</p>
               <p>WHY should we travellers overlook the rising generation, and, for the most part, pass them by in silence?</p>
               <p>'Tis no news to tell the reader, that they are, what we have been; and that they will be what we now are: - whether better or worse depends at present upon their governors, and in future upon themselves.</p>
               
            <pb n="198" xml:id="pb-198" facs="#i198"/>
               <p>As a lover of mankind, and the father of a family, I am particularly interested in their well-being; and to behold a number of children decent, orderly, well-bread - of growing virtues and promising abilities, such as are to be met with in every city in FLANDERS and BRABANT; reflects great honour upon their parents and instructors, and cannot fail to give pleasure to strangers.</p>
               <p>Improper language among them is totally forbid; passions are lulled by mutual kindnesses; resentments are not carried to extremes; differences are accommodated by their superiors, and very rarely end in black eyes and bloody noses.</p>
               <p>Their exercises and diversions are, in general, less violent and inflammatory than with us; and when they are apprenticed to the trade of war, it is</p>
               
            <pb n="199" xml:id="pb-199" facs="#i199"/>
               <p>thought time enough for them to learn to fight.</p>
               <p>Among other childish amusements, I was vastly taken with the innocent and common one of flying birds. -</p>
               <p>Almost every boy has his tame sparrow, or linnet, and his perch: - the bird is left off with a thread, and with a whistle or of his own accord returns to the perch again. - Both parties appear perfectly happy, insomuch that 'tis difficult to say which is most pleased.</p>
               <p>'Tis true this kind of entertainment commonly ends in the destruction of the nurselings; by cramming, over-fatiguing, or carelessly leaving them to merciless grimalkin.</p>
               <p>But then the sorrow which succeeds the loss, is more than enough to wash away the guilt of inconsideration! -</p>
               
            <pb n="200" xml:id="pb-200" facs="#i200"/>
               <p>And who knows but that such grief may make a lasting impression; - may be the constant, though unconscious prelude to tenderest compassion; - and that the future manly breast, may never thereafter be steeled against another's misfortune?</p>
               <p>Could we trace the effect from so slight a cause; I should venture to conclude that the heart cannot be softened too early.</p>
               <p>I confess I have stopt frequently to gaze at, and enjoy this boyish pastime: - and, in my own mind, preferred it to spitting beetles, drowning kittens, hanging dogs, fighting cocks, hunting ducks; and even to the more harmless diversion of cat-and-platter.</p>
               <p>But I shall betray myself - and the discerning reader will find out, that I want spirit for great actions.</p>

            <pb n="202" xml:id="pb-202" facs="#i202"/>
               <p>bring all my materials, within the proposed limitation.</p>
               <p>The lordling appeared to be about sixteen years old - and his tutor was, as I judged, about my own age - a little turned of forty.</p>
               <p>The reason why I am so particular as to their age; is to shew how much the raw inexperience of sixteen, must stand in need of the experienced gravity of forty.</p>
               <p>If the pupil had been five or six years older, it would not have signified much, even tho' the tutor had been ten years younger.</p>
               <p>There is as much propriety requisite in coupling the ages at one time of life, as the sexes at another: - But the great art of chusing men, is a secret</p>
               
            <pb n="203" xml:id="pb-203" facs="#i203"/>
               <p>known but to a few - practised by still fewer.</p>
               <p>So if the lordling had been only of the tender age of eleven or twelve - in that case, the governor would have wanted full twenty years, to have qualified him for a nurse's place.</p>
               <p>With these I associated frequently for some three, or four days - we commonly dined together, and often visited the churches and monasteries of that superb city.</p>
               <p>The noble pupil, added to the easy politeness of the high-born of his country, had much more taste and curiosity about him, than might have been expected - from whence I concluded, the former part of his time had not been entirely portioned out among fidlers, dancing-masters and maitres-de-jeu - and the governor's attention</p>
               
            <pb n="204" xml:id="pb-204" facs="#i204"/>
               <p>was always awake to animate and improve them.</p>
               <p>The paintings and sculptures of ANTWERP display a large field for the lovers of art - and if the preceptor was liberal in communicating, the pupil was no less eager to learn.</p>
               <p>It was evident that a proper authority was lodged in the one; and a becoming deference in the disposition of the other, was full as apparent - but both were free and unrestrained.</p>
               <p>If there was no servile adulation on the part of the governor; it might be that he was actuated more by principle, than motives of interest; independent of future church or state-preferment: - and if no tiresome disgust appeared in the pupil, it was because he considered the other, more as</p>
               
            <pb n="205" xml:id="pb-205" facs="#i205"/>
               <p>an improving companion, than as a rigid guide.</p>
               <p>The governor would not have abandoned his charge for a single hour, upon any consideration: - the pupil would have thought it a tedious hour, if spent in any company without the presence of his friend.</p>
               <p>The preceptor had certainly the art of instructing by example, and polite insinuation. -</p>
               <p>But some people, neglecting every requisite of address and engaging behaviour, vainly imagine, that to be able to instruct others, 'tis sufficient to be unmannerly learned themselves.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLIV.</p>
               <p>A few Remarks upon Antwerp; with some of the Author's Reasons for not attempting a finished book of Travels.</p>
               <p>THE magnificence of ANTWERP is solid, and built upon the best and surest foundation: -</p>
               <p>It consists not only of stately edifices both public and private, but in the substantial riches of many of its inhabitants - as also in superb cabinets and splendid equipages.</p>
               <p>There are no false colours hung out here - nor any who keep up an appearance of grandeur, but such as are of known rank and of sufficient fortune to support it.</p>
               
            <pb n="207" xml:id="pb-207" facs="#i207"/>
               <p>It is well known that the Antwerpians have no longer any trade - but from the vast treasures which formerly flowed in upon them, few are so well enabled to carry on the business of exchange; in which beneficial branch of commerce, great sums are transacted here - and with more ease, as it is said, than even in trading cities.</p>
               <p>The most wealthy, and those who are possessed of cabinets, stand charged by travellers with shyness to strangers, and an excessive love of retirement: - the first, I apprehend, may be owing to the great number of impertinents which they have been pestered with, and the abuses by them committed: - the latter from the sober rule of life adopted here - there hours of table, of recreation and of rest being very unlike what is practised with us.</p>
               
            <pb n="208" xml:id="pb-208" facs="#i208"/>
               <p>Nothing is more prevalent than fashion, whether good or bad; and what we usually call regularity, depends in a great measure, upon the customary allotment of the twenty-four hours. - Midnight in LONDON, or PARIS, among the fashionable and the dissolute, is full as chearful as mid-day: - but at ANTWERP it is quite otherwise; where to be irregular, is to be unfashionable.</p>
               <p>The markets here are well supplied - there is great abundance and at reasonable rates - which must be the case in every fertile country, under proper regulation.</p>
               <p>Beggars, notwithstanding, abound in this wealthy city, as in most other towns of BRABANT and FLANDERS; but a set of wretches distinguished among us by the name of black guards, are no where to be found in the provinces.</p>
               
            <pb n="209" xml:id="pb-209" facs="#i209"/>
               <p>- To the church, I apprehend, is greatly owing the toleration of the former; and to the vigilance of the magistracy, the prevention of the latter.</p>
               <p>I was much pleased with the good order and regularity of one of their village-fairs; which was opened with solemn church-service, and a procession, in honour of the saint to whom the church was dedicated.</p>
               <p>The origin of fairs, in the opinion of our learned antiquary Sir HENRY SPELMAN, is derived from the anniversaries of the dedications of churches. - This may serve somewhat to illustrate that authority. - No wonder then that such commencement in devotion, should continue in civil mirth, and terminate in decency.</p>
               
            <pb n="210" xml:id="pb-210" facs="#i210"/>
               <p>But I perceive there's no working to any purpose, without good materials; and in my opinion 'tis impossible to make a finished book of travels, without the joint labours of a number who have gone the same road before us.</p>
               <p>I will appeal to some two, or three, or half a dozen of the gentlemen themselves - in whose toilsome travellings and painful peregrinations you will be sure to find the same quaint remarks - the same dull descriptions of the same objects - insomuch that one would be almost tempted to believe they had been of the same party - or that each had revised the works of his brother-pilgrim.</p>
               <p>I fancy I have discovered this grand secret. - Most of them, depend upon't, had read the same guides thro' the same places: - after their return, I presume</p>
               
            <pb n="211" xml:id="pb-211" facs="#i211"/>
               <p>- for it is pretty evident they had not always time to read them upon the spot.</p>
               <p>I'm sure I read my GUIDE D'ANVERS thro' and thro' upon the spot - and ran about here and there, wherever he directed me: - but then, I must inform you, it took me up eleven days; tho' it is but a very little book - yet it contains a description of all the public buildings and curiosities, beginning with the cathedral, or church of our lady; and ending with the concern-room.</p>
               <p>This little book translated and swelled with commentary, might have made a much larger book. - But setting the little book aside (for there would have been no occasion to mention it at all) - Why not have taken the marrow, and brought it in proof of my own industry? - Who would have doubted, or who would have been at the pains to detect the fraud?</p>
               
            <pb n="212" xml:id="pb-212" facs="#i212"/>
               <p>'What marvellous industry! cries one - Consummate genius! says another - Who would have thought it? says another - so full! - so indefatigable! - He must have had no time for food or sleep - and ten to one but it throws him into a galloping consumption! -</p>
               <p>'Why he knows every street, every building, every picture, every statue; full as well as the planner, the paviour, the architect, the painter, the sculptor.</p>
               <p>'Well, 'tis prodigious! says the first - once more, Who would have thought it?'</p>
               <p>Vile book-making! say I - I detest it!</p>
               <p>'But why not favour us with a few of those numerous curiosities, which would have cost you so little trouble?'</p>
               <p>Because they are all to be found in the little book; which you may buy at every shop for two or three schillings.</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLV.</p>
               <p>The Traveller visits Ruben's House - thence follow some Reflections upon Artists, Cabinets, and Connoisseurship.</p>
               <p>I Had patroled before the gate several times - and was as often possessed with a certain reverence for superior talents.</p>
               <p>Here once lived RUBENS, thought I - creative RUBENS! - Within these walls once flourished the man, whose fame shall never die!</p>
               <p>ANTWERP had formerly acquired a trade, which rendered her the pride of her neighbouring provinces, and drew upon her the envy of all EUROPE! - That trade she lost - lost irrecoverably!</p>
               <p>She afterwards gained an artist; whose works are now her pride, and still preserve her an object of general envy, though in a different kind.</p>
               
            <pb n="214" xml:id="pb-214" facs="#i214"/>
               <p>People still flock to ANTWERP - and for what? to visit the remains of RUBENS - no other errand.</p>
               <p>Not because she was once the first emporium of commerce - the lightening-column of navigation to all the world, and had extended her trade beyond what any other city could boast before her. - Those days are past - we can only read now that such and such things were formerly transacted there; and we believe them true from many circumstances.</p>
               <p>But here's conviction - here's speaking canvas for you!</p>
               <p>RUBENS was, is now, and will continue her living, lasting fame!</p>
               <p>Prodigious! - that one man's memory and good works, should attract more than the numberless monuments of thrift, the foundations of families, and</p>
               
            <pb n="215" xml:id="pb-215" facs="#i215"/>
               <p>the remembrance that millions were once gained there by barter!</p>
               <p>Learn from this example, ye sons of affluence! to cherish superior talents - if not for your own, it may be for your country's good in future time.</p>
               <p>I set out with saying, I had patroled before the gate several times - where there was nothing to be seen: - but one day, the present possessor, De Heer B- perceiving my attention without, very cordially invited me in.</p>
               <p>Here also there was little to be seen; for the house was full of workmen, who were considerably enlarging and beautifying the premises, and the pictures were all taken down.</p>
               <p>However I had the satisfaction of seeing some of the apartments which the great artist had contrived - of walking</p>
               
            <pb n="216" xml:id="pb-216" facs="#i216"/>
               <p>in the garden which he had planned, and viewing some of the statues which he loved.</p>
               <p>The academy of painting I visited no doubt - and according to custom, you may be sure, squatted myself down in RUBENS's chair.</p>
               <p>I was pleased with the conceit of finding it made a part of the exchange, by being situated over it. - Commerce and arts should ever be united.</p>
               <p>I was not so fortunate as to be introduced to any first-rate artists in that city - I suspect they are but thinly sown.</p>
               <p>The most extraordinary one I heard of (who, by the by, is no artist, but a very singular copier) is one ANTHONY VAN OVERLAET, a baker (dessinateur sans Maitre, as he called) - many of whose works I saw.</p>
               
            <pb n="217" xml:id="pb-217" facs="#i217"/>
               <p>He takes off all subjects, and all manners as near as possible, in pen and ink; which he executes inimitably, and is doubtless the first fac simile man in EUROPE.</p>
               <p>They may now boast their BAKER, as formerly they did their BLACKSMITH.</p>
               <p>'Pray, Monsieur CORIAT LE JEUNE' (he had learnt my name you find) said a petit-maitre en tableaux from Paris to me, one day, as we were walking upon the ramparts - he seemed to have about as much business at Antwerp as myself - 'Have you any artists, said he, in England?'</p>
               <p>Several hundreds! sir, said I.</p>
               <p>'Eh! mon dieu!' said the Frenchman, and started back three paces - recovering himself. -</p>
               <p>'But, mon cher monsieur! said he, you certainly misapprehend me! - I know you have an infinite number of watch-makers, buckle-makers, snuff-box-makers,</p>
               
            <pb n="218" xml:id="pb-218" facs="#i218"/>
               <p>jack-smiths, and razor-makers - but have you any - I mean - what you call artists?'</p>
               <p>Some of the first in every branch of art, was my answer.</p>
               <p>'Eh! mon dieu!' said the Frenchman again - but with a start of only about half the length of the former.</p>
               <p>'Tis a common exclamation among some of those of whom I am speaking, thought I. -</p>
               <p>'But, sir, interrogated the Frenchman once more, do you mean painters?'</p>
               <p>Some scores; who well deserve that designation.</p>
               <p>'I have never heard of one of them, Diable m'emporte!'</p>
               <p>I am sorry for it, sir.</p>
               <p>'In Paris, continued he, we deny the possibility of an Englishman's being able to paint!'</p>
               
            <pb n="219" xml:id="pb-219" facs="#i219"/>
               <p>The French, sir, said I, are too sparing of their commendations to foreign artists - you may possibly guess the reasons.</p>
               <p>'O, non, reply'd his connoisseurship, <note>FRENCH</note>je vous demande pardon! - we allow you every thing! - Vous etes des braves gens! - fort honnÃ©te! - enfin! - Mais pour la peinture! - c'est une autre affaire! - Among such numbers, could you name me a few? - nommez un peu!'</p>
               <p>A plague on their English names! thought I - most of them - what shall I say now? - O! I have it.</p>
               <p>Why, sir, give me leave to say, it must be a want of recollection in your, not to remember even the names of some of our first-rate painters. - the many fine things of this city, I suspect, have driven them out of your head.</p>
               <p>Is it possible that so accomplished a gentleman, can be ignorant of the names of Rinaldo, Ramzei, Cotesi, Tomsono, Mieri! - Who has not heard of Haimani,</p>
               
            <pb n="220" xml:id="pb-220" facs="#i220"/>
               <p>Amiltoni, Alessandro, Ouesti, Danza, Fuseli, Zoffani, Pino, Mortimeri, Stubbesi, Voluseno, MarloÃ©, Gansberghi, Smitti, Stuarta, Peteri, and many, many more!</p>
               <p>Then for ladies, we have la Donna Redi, la Signora Moseri, e la bella ANGELICA!</p>
               <p>All the while I was running over my catalogue, my Frenchman was keeping time with a string of interjections - such as, Ah! Pah! O! Eh! Oui-da! Diantre! &amp;c. which finally terminated in a plaguy long Di-aaa-ble!</p>
               <p>'I cry you mercy! said the connoisseur - I have heard of every one of them again and again; and am ashamed of the trouble I have given you: - but their names are so Dutch; that, I protest, I always took them for Portuguese, or Germans! - Pox take my stupidity! - What was I thinking of?'</p>
               <p>Thus I saved the credit of my country's artists with this coxcomb, in a</p>
               
            <pb n="221" xml:id="pb-221" facs="#i221"/>
               <p>great measure, meerly by altering some of their names.</p>
               <p>But we have connoisseurs in ENGLAND too.</p>
               <p>ANTWERP may be considered as one large cabinet, to which all EUROPE is invited - but there are also several lesser ones within the greater, well worth the inspection of the curious, to which they cannot easily get admittance.</p>
               <p>My little interest procured me but the sight of two; Baron Van SCH-L's, and the Chanoine K-F's: - the first replete with treasures of most arts; the second exhibiting a fine shew of paintings only.</p>
               <p>The freedom with which I saw them, made it quite agreeable; and put more and more out of conceit with the impertinence of Mrs. CLEARSIGHT, and the formality of my old Lady GUSTO.</p>
               
            <pb n="222" xml:id="pb-222" facs="#i222"/>
               <p>''Tis very hard upon painters, says Mrs. CLEARSIGHT, to have judges that can't see!' - Very hard indeed! madam - equally so, I apprehend, as upon authors, to have judges that can't read.</p>
               <p>'After all, the sweetest of painters to my mind, said Mrs. CLEARSIGHT, is SUGARELLI!'</p>
               <p>'There's life, and heat, and warmth, and glow, and fire, and fancy for you! -</p>
               <p>Such figures, such suns! such risings, such settings! such proportion, such keeping! -</p>
               <p>'He warms you, he fans you, he cools you! - in short, he does whatever he pleases with you!</p>
               <p>'Can't you perswade yourself that yon man is running - that yon water is falling - that yon horse is starting - that yon doe is bounding? -</p>
               <p>'Surely you can' or you must have no eyes!</p>
               
            <pb n="223" xml:id="pb-223" facs="#i223"/>
               <p>You must stand where I do - a little more to the right - look thro; your hand thus - incline your body a little forward - now you're right - Well, now can't you see it? - I warrant you!'</p>
               <p>'Tis really a severe penance to see all the fine things my Lady GUSTO has to shew you; since 'tis impossible to take in the whole compas of her imagination upon the master at first sight.</p>
               <p>The master of the day, with her ladyship, is the greatest master that ever was, or ever will be! - the picture before you, is the greatest picture of the greatest master! - You may rest assured that 'tis in his best manner! - his highest taste! - the only one which he executed in that super-superlative gout! - and of which he was prouder, than of all the rest of his works put together!</p>
               <p>One would be apt to imagine, that upon Raphael's day, no one would be so hardy as to dispute the majesty of RAPHAEL. - if Correggio's, the grace and </p>
               
            <pb n="224" xml:id="pb-224" facs="#i224"/>
               <p>glow of CORREGGIO - if Dolce's, the divinity of DOLCE - if Rubens's, the inexhaustible invention of RUBENS: - in which case, each would be tolerably secure upon his own bottom.</p>
               <p>But her ladyship is persuaded that that would not be making the most of her cabinet: - She is for taking each separately, and alternately concentring the whole graphic art in one: - So that upon CARLO's day; RAPHAEL wants majesty, CORREGGIO colouring, DOLCE sweetness, and RUBENS is become scarce worthy to hold a pallet.</p>
               <p>So much for her ladyship's criticism - now you shall have one of her histories.</p>
               <p>'This picture, by the meerest accident - by the greatest good fortune in the world! fell to my lot. - I can't account for it - other people saw it before me - but no body was satisfied about the master!</p>
               <p>'Many were present when I purchased it - the first judges in the kingdom -</p>
               
            <pb n="225" xml:id="pb-225" facs="#i225"/>
               <p>but there they stood, with their hands in their pockets, and their mouths sealed up - conjured into a state of stupefaction!</p>
               <p>'Pray put it in! said Prestage. - Five hundred guineas! said I - a general hum went round the room! - a pause of five minutes! - not a word uttered! - Down went the hammer! -</p>
               <p>'Mine! said I - and, curtsying to the company - I am obliged to your connoisseurships, for having saved me as many thousands!</p>
               <p>'But 'ere twenty-four hours were at an end, the eyes of them all were opened, and they beheld the nakedness of their understandings! -</p>
               <p>'Signor FRESCO, left the kingdom upon it immediately, and returned to his own country; which he ne'er had done, but for that accident.</p>
               <p>'My lord CONTOUR, fell into a melancholy, and died delirious about three</p>
               
            <pb n="226" xml:id="pb-226" facs="#i226"/>
               <p>months after: - His last words were, 'Sdeath! - to be outdone by a woman! -</p>
               <p>'His relations therefore concluded, that he died for love of some unknown beauty: - It would have been barbarous in me to have set them right - but the true cause was, as I have related - and as he had lived a slave, so it was fit he should fall a sacrifice to false taste.</p>
               <p>'As for poor SCURO; I think, they say, he has not ventured to shew his face in an auction-room ever since.'</p>
               <p>But my good gentlemen and lady-connoisseurs! patrons of shades! re-edifiers of fallen temples! and quickeners of dead laurels! - 'Tis not enough, after their deaths, to gather their remains at any price: - See also that ye feed them while they live!</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLVI.</p>
               <p>Somewhat about Courtesy.</p>
               <p>HOW amiable a quality is COURTESY! (or call it politeness, or civility, if you had rather) - how pleasing to friends! - how winning to strangers!</p>
               <p>Among the first, it cannot chuse but daily to strengthen the cement of social happiness: - from the latter, it removes the fatigue of travel - it alleviates the pain of absence, and naturalizes us at once in a foreign land!</p>
               <p>It is the primitive washing of the feet - aud not the effect, but only the mode is changed.</p>
               <p>In whatever country this principle is wholly uncultivated (if any such there be) the inhabitants must needs be more savage, than their kindred brutes: - and wherever it is neglected; such neglect</p>
               
            <pb n="228" xml:id="pb-228" facs="#i228"/>
               <p>is generally visible in their arts, as well as in the manners and passions of most ranks of people.</p>
               <p>This lesser philosophy, as the FRENCH elegantly term it -</p>
               <p>'Da-m the FRENCH! - I saw plainly where you was driving! - What have we to do with the FRENCH? - Have n't they had drubbing enough yet? - Well then, let 'em wait a little' -</p>
               <p>Peace, ruffian! and don't interrupt what thou can'st not comprehend.</p>
               <p>This lesser philosophy engagingly demeans itself to all characters and situations; but delights more especially in administering to the commodity of pilgrims and strangers - among whom it may well be accounted a CARDINAL VIRTUE.</p>
               <p>The FLEMINGS are half FRENCH in this particular -</p>
               
            <pb n="229" xml:id="pb-229" facs="#i229"/>
               <p>'That's enough! - just half is enough.'</p>
               <p>The LIEGOIS wholly so -</p>
               <p>'That's too much! - too much by one-half.'</p>
               <p>- I grant you it may be overdone, even to a degree of apish folly - in the excess whereof it ceases to be the virtue for which I contend.</p>
               <p>But if founded in sentiment, and enlivened by practice - if arising from a love of conformity, a knowledge of mankind, and the result of a good disposition: - If the smallest particle of benignity is to be found at the bottom; it must have its weight in the ballance of national excellence.</p>
               <p>'Tis all grimace! - a mixture of unmeaning affectation and palpable design: - The blunt humanity of the ENGLISH, is more adapted to the manners of men; and best bespeaks the generosity of a free people.'</p>
               
            <pb n="230" xml:id="pb-230" facs="#i230"/>
               <p>I agree with you, that the honest complacency of many of our countrymen, is a sufficient apology for a thousand superfluous shrugs and scrapes.</p>
               <p>Yet as few are judges of the worth of the gem in the rough; it follows that some polish is absolutely necessary, to make it of general estimation.</p>
               <p>By over acting, on the one hand, if we have too much the air of fops; so, on the other, we shall have too much the appearance of barbarians.</p>
               <p>'I had much rather be thought the latter; than wear the tawdry outside of the former.'</p>
               <p>Both extremes are to be avoided.</p>
               <p>'But, pox on't! what's to become of my sincerity?'</p>
               <p>You may preserve that, and be nevertheless the well-bred citizen.</p>
               
            <pb n="231" xml:id="pb-231" facs="#i231"/>
               <p>'I doubt it: - those bowing, cringing, parlez-vous mounseers, depending upon't! have always some dirty design at bottom! - It is not for nothing, that they so beslobber and becompliment.'</p>
               <p>'Tis the most absurd prejudice, as well as uncharitable conclusion that can be offered - and take my word for't, bluntness may conceal the designing knave, as well as civility.</p>
               <p>'In which case, I should be cheated in my own way; and could much sooner forgive the injury; - the one, wearing the mask of an honest man, the other, of a puppy.'</p>
               <p>You are vastly mistaken, I promise you. -</p>
               <p>What can be more disinterested than the behaviour of these Antwerpians respecting strangers? - for a native to put himself into a disadvantageous situation, meerly to accommodate one whom he</p>
               
            <pb n="232" xml:id="pb-232" facs="#i232"/>
               <p>never saw before? - Would you do as much?</p>
               <p>'I should chuse to keep my place, if 'twas a good one.'</p>
               <p>With the most engaging urbanity - <note>FRENCH</note>Vous etes etranger! monsieur - prenez ma place! - mettez vous la! - vous verrez mieux! -</p>
               <p>'Very civil, I confess.'</p>
               <p>Not only the common people (for the virtue of civility influences all ranks) will run to serve you; but here the courteous, his dinner, to accompany the stranger the length of two or three streets, that he may not mistake his way - as I have frequently experienced.</p>
               <p>'That's going a good way indeed! - I should have told him to take the first, second, or third turning on the right, or left - and then to enquire further.'</p>
               
            <pb n="233" xml:id="pb-233" facs="#i233"/>
               <p>After this sketch of general Antwerpian manners, should I descend to particular characters, my good friend, De Heer VAN M-, must stand foremost in the list of my obligations. - One who has happily blended Brabanson courtesy, with the blunt hospitality of the ENGLISH.</p>
               <p>'Ay - that's the man for me!'</p>
               <p>One who lays himself out to do acts of beneficence to all; but more particularly to the traveller of our nation: - who never wearies of doing good offices - thereby honouring himself, and no less his fellow-citizens.</p>
               <p>'Now and then we hear of such men.'</p>
               <p>Lastly, the kindnesses of my worthy chanoine K-, must not be forgotten: A private ecclesiastic, blest in a princely fortune, but more in a liberal heart.</p>
               <p>If pictures delight you; his cabinet furnishes the first masters, in the finest preservation: - If good cheer is your object;</p>
               
            <pb n="234" xml:id="pb-234" facs="#i234"/>
               <p>no man entertains with more splendor, less ceremony, and a heartier welcome.</p>
               <p>In only one instance he can be said to over-do it - which is, That tho' his Burgundy is as delicious as any vintage ever produced; he is apt to regret that it is not better for your sake.</p>
               <p>That nothing may be wanting to recreate, in this mansion of hospitality; he keeps, for the entertainment of the ladies, one of the gentlest and prettiest monkies - the most playful of his kind that can be imagined! -</p>
               <p>'I should like much to play with the Chanoine's monkey! -</p>
               <p>'After all, I commend you for representing the people as you found them. - Good offices claim gratitude - and however deficient some of us may appear in point of POLITENESS; give me leave to tell you, they can only rank among the basest of our people, who stand justly charged with INGRATITUDE.'</p>

               <p>CHAP. XLVII.</p>
               <p>Which draws towards the Conclusion of the Second Part.</p>
               <p>I Was vastly pleased t'other day with an ingenious device of my little book-seller's! - the prettiest contrivance of splitting tow books into four that every I heard of - and is here inserted, that authors, as often as they find an unexpected swell in their works, may make a proper use of it.</p>
               <p>But first, it will be necessary to inform my readers, that the same gentleman did me the honour of a visit, in my third story, about the beginning of last May.</p>
               <p>Upon his first entrance, I perceived, as I thought, a mixture of chagrin and fatigue in his countenance; which I imputed, in a great measure, to the narrowness of the stairs, the aukward steps, the short turnings and the confounded way up.</p>
               
            <pb n="236" xml:id="pb-236" facs="#i236"/>
               <p>When under the least dejection of spirit, and having no one to quarrel with; I make it a rule to curse them heartily myself: - In which case it is not to be wondered that they should try another's patience, who is less used to them, and is not under the same tie.</p>
               <p>How do you do? Mr. JOHNSON - was my first salutation: - and then rising very civilly from my seat - Here, friend, said I, you may take the chair - you seem fatigued - I chuse to stand - or I can walk about - Walking, I account wholesome exercise - and I have n't yet measured my room this morning.</p>
               <p>'In the language of Pater-Noster-Row,' reply'd my bookseller (with uncommon severity of aspect) 'we say that authors stand, or are at a stand, when their work stands still: - and even tho' it should be found they had been sitting, to no purpose; we should not alter the phrase a tittle.</p>
               
            <pb n="237" xml:id="pb-237" facs="#i237"/>
               <p>'This, let me tell you, Mr. CORIAT, sometimes keeps printers at a stand - and what is still more, booksellers at a stand. - The work, heaven knows! is often bought and paid for - but how are we to get at it? - It may be that the author from the moment he signed, sealed and touched; never gave himself any further concern about it.</p>
               <p>'The money is gone past recovery! - Who are we to sue? - and for what? - an author's indigested plan? - ridiculous!</p>
               <p>'Need I inform Mr. CORIAT, that such practices, put literary contracts too much upon the hazardous footing of debts of honour - I could only wish that they were as honourably discharged.</p>
               <p>'Now, sir, give me leave to infer, that when authors neither sit, nor stand to any purpose; it follows, they make walk about and divert themselves - as long as they are satisfied that walking is a wholesome exercise.' -</p>
               
            <pb n="238" xml:id="pb-238" facs="#i238"/>
               <p>You are very logical this morning -</p>
               <p>'I shall be glad to find you are struck with the reason.'</p>
               <p>And I assure you there is some spice of wit, and a good deal of pleasantry in your argument -</p>
               <p>'So that it has but the force of an argument; you are heartily welcome to the wit.'</p>
               <p>Thank you for nothing.</p>
               <p>'But to business. - By contract (which I have in my pocket) - bearing date - let me see - ay, here it is - "the - day of July in the seventh year of the reign of our sovereign lord George the third, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland king, defender of the faith, and so forth; and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven - It is covenanted and agreed by the between the parties, and so forth - that for</p>

               <p>The money was very current, that's certain - I don't recollect the smallest objection I had to it at the time.</p>

               <p>You know I have all along told you, I wanted but a few connective chapters to complete the whole? -</p>
               <p>Such, Sir, are not to be had for studying - for meer wishing - Reflections must come of themselves.</p>

               <p>Being the last but one of this Volume.</p>
               <p>WITH such answer, and a promise to bring matters to a speedy conclusion, we parted good friends. - And now comes his ingenious device -</p>
               <p>At our next meeting, which happened a few days since, he addressed me after the following peremptory manner. -</p>
               <p>'Mr. CORIAT, said he, I intend publishing this day fortnight' -</p>
               <p>Lord! Sir - you surprize me! - how can that be? - I am not ready -</p>

               <p>'As much as ever you will be,' returned the bookseller.</p>
               <p>I have only two or three connective chapters -</p>
               <p>'With the hope of which you have amused me for thrice three months.</p>
               <p>'It does not signify, Sir - the book is mine - and I am resolved. - You may connect what is to come, with what you have by you - they may possibly come into play, as third and fourth parts - What is already printed in order, I mean forthwith to publish as first and second' -</p>
               <p>A mighty pretty fancy! - and pray where is your conclusion? - I was just going to send my directions for travelling to the printer.</p>

               <p>With many more - some of which have been printed this twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>'The greater is my loss, Mr. CORIAT - this is the unavoidable consequence of printing without a plan - of trusting to conceited authors, who neither know where to begin, nor where to leave off.'</p>
               <p>Well - and my confession of faith! (which some may be very curious to see) - what's to become of that?</p>
               <p>'O, that - that will come in its proper place - where you all along intended it - at the close of the second volume or fourth part.'</p>

               <p>But not so fast, friend - hitherto you seem to have calculated very well for yourself: - But will there be no further consideration due to me? - am I to furnish four books at the rate of two?</p>
               <p>'Don't call 'em books, Mr. CORIAT - you know they will be only parts - they will still be but two volumes.'</p>

               <p>MANY of my readers, I dare say, thought I had sat down with an intention to write a book of travels: - and indeed I thought so myself at first.</p>

               <p>Now who can foresee the consequence to a hopeless author, of such an unaccountable swerving from his original plan? - It may be as much to me as my book is worth, for aught I know. -</p>
               <p>The curious traveller, from meer disappointment, may be provoked to damn the author and the work too!</p>
               <p>'Was there ever known such a rascally thing, from the creation to this present writing? - Why the fellow might as well have picked my pocket!</p>
               
            <pb n="251" xml:id="pb-251" facs="#i251"/>
               <p>- Much better; and I could sooner have forgiven the poor dog! - but to think of drawing five shillings from me, upon sham pretences, and false titles, is unpardonable!'</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. JOHNSON, return that gentleman his money: - and with some addition, let me recommend to his perusal the accurate MISSON - or the more accurate BLAINVILLE; who frequently corrects his mistakes and oversights: - both are full of pictures - which it may be he wants. -</p>
               <p>I have no such embellishments to boast - only here and there a slight sketch, drawn originally by the pencil of NATURE; but which must have suffered much, and have lost a great deal of their first beauty and spirit, in having been traced by me.</p>
               
            <pb n="252" xml:id="pb-252" facs="#i252"/>
               <p>But above all, if ever he means to depart the kingdom; let me caution him not to trust his foot on foreign European shore, without the GRAND TOUR in his pocket; of which, if he is careful, and makes a good use - he may chance to bring is back again.</p>
               <p>Of all things I admire the circumstantial accounts given by some of my brother-travellers; who in their post-haste journies, it may be from LONDON to PARIS, or BRUSSELS, will not omit so much as a turnpike, or a sign-post.</p>
               <p>The number of churches, convents, houses, inhabitants, markets, fairs, in each town are meer A. B. C. to them - you may have the successions of all the mayors and recorders from their first incorporation, if you require</p>
               
            <pb n="253" xml:id="pb-253" facs="#i253"/>
               <p>I am at a loss for which to envy them most; their vast memory, or great industry! - Pray, sir, what stay did you make at - ?</p>
               <p>'We breakfasted there.'</p>
               <p>Prodigious! - How long was you at - ?</p>
               <p>'We changed horses'</p>
               <p>That was quick work! - How long at - ?</p>
               <p>'We dined there.'</p>
               <p>You seem to have snapt up a great deal in a short time! - I conclude you passed some weeks at - ?</p>
               <p>'No; we only lay there one night.'</p>
               
            <pb n="254" xml:id="pb-254" facs="#i254"/>
               <p>I'm persuaded you slept but a little; for you seem to know much more of the matter, than this gentleman who was born there. - *****, I'm told, is a fine city.</p>
               <p>'O yes, mighty fine! - monstrous fine, indeed! - a very pretty sort of a place; and a good sort of people.'</p>
               <p>Extremely civil to strangers, I suppose?</p>
               <p>'O, immensely civil! - they say the civilest things in the world - in short, they surfeit you with their civility.'</p>
               <p>'Tis very large, they say -</p>
               <p>'About nine miles round.'</p>
               <p>You saw every thing, I presume -</p>
               <p></p>
               
            <pb n="255" xml:id="pb-255" facs="#i255"/>
               <p>'Every thing in the world, that was worth seeing.'</p>
               <p>It must have taken up some time -</p>
               <p>'You're vastly mistaken - O, sir, 'tis quick as thought, when once you are got into the method. - We only breakfasted there - and I remember had excellent chocolate, and some of the best rusks I have ever eat in my life.'</p>
               <p>I admire you brought away so much in so short a time.</p>
               <p>'There's nothing in it, I promise you; after you have seen three, or four principal places - 'tis only the same thing over and over again.</p>
               <p>'I could put you in a way that you might see more in twelve or fourteen days, than some who have squandered</p>
               
            <pb n="256" xml:id="pb-256" facs="#i256"/>
               <p>as many months: - Only be a good boy, and mind your book! as they say to the children - with a little instruction, take my word for't - 'tis as easy as scating to a Dutchman.'</p>
               <p>I shall be much obliged to you: - and though 'tis too late in life for me to receive any personal benefit from it: yet as I have a son, upon whom I have bestowed just education enough, to let him see that the world is full of as great blockheads as himself; I might be tempted hereafter to be at the further expence of a month's travel for him, by way of a finish.</p>
               <p>'You are perfectly in the right: - there's nothing opens the mind like travel - 'tis the Passe-par-tout to men and things; and fills your head with Je ne scai quoys, and your heels avec des bonnes graces! - To be sure, I should not speak</p>
               
            <pb n="257" xml:id="pb-257" facs="#i257"/>
               <p>it of myself; but, upon my honour! I saw more of the world in a fortnight, than I had done before during my whole life.'</p>
               <p>You seem to have acquired some language too.</p>
               <p>'One can't help picking up a little - though, to tell you the truth, I had much to do sometimes to make the mounseers understand me.</p>
               <p>'Well then, first and foremost, remember you are to set out with the GRAND TOUR in your pocket; for that may absolutely be called, A TREASURE FOR ENGLISH TTAVELLERS; and will save you a vast deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>'At every place of note provide yourself with a fresh almanack, and the last printed guide.</p>
               
            <pb n="258" xml:id="pb-258" facs="#i258"/>
               <p>Order your cocher, or chariotier, to drive you the contrary ways to those by which you came into, and are to go out of the town: - by that means you will see the extremities, and may have an opportunity of counting the gates.</p>
               <p>'If you purpose to stay for a few hours, send for a valet de p'ace at once; and desire them to chuse a nimble fellow, who can run about with you; - for some of them are cursed slow!</p>
               <p>'While your valet is coming, run over the account or the place in your TOUR; draw your pen through such as you judge most worthy of observation (for 'twill be impossible to see them all) the rest you must take for granted.</p>
               <p>'As soon as he comes, set him about reading your guides and almanacks, if you can't read them yourself: - But</p>
               
            <pb n="259" xml:id="pb-259" facs="#i259"/>
               <p>be sure to fix upon your places before you set out; otherwise he will be for leading you the devil of a dance, under the notion of shewing you every thing!</p>
               <p>'Your excursion over, enter your particulars after the following manner;</p>
               <p>Gates       Parish-churches</p>
               <p>Streets     Convents</p>
               <p>Bridges     Houses</p>
               <p>Cathedral   Inhabitants</p>
               <p>And your remarkables, as they happen to fall out. -</p>
               <p>'For example; Such a picture may be seen in such a place; such a relic, in such another: - Such a man was born here; and such another was buried here: - My lord Such-a-one lives in this street; and may lady Such-a-one in that square: - The VIRGIN MARY, with her own hands, built such a chapel; and the DEVIL flew</p>
               
            <pb n="260" xml:id="pb-260" facs="#i260"/>
               <p>away with such a steeple! - The stadthouse is considerably larger than my lord mayor's mansion-house; and the tower of such a church, somewhat higher than St. Paul's cross.</p>
               <p>'This correctness will be rather tiresome in the beginning; but it wears off insensibly; and after having visited a few places, you may save yourself that needless trouble; for, as I told you before, 'tis only a repetition of the same.</p>
               <p>'There is also a good deal in knowing the temper and genius of the people - which is soon learnt; and then you may set about supposing - but that depends upon the country where you are.</p>
               <p>'If, in FLANDERS, you may suppose the cities fortified, and full of churches and convents - the churches, full of pictures; the convents, full</p>
               
            <pb n="261" xml:id="pb-261" facs="#i261"/>
               <p>of monks; the people, full of superstition; the streets, full of beggars.</p>
               <p>'The same supposition will hold good for almost any Roman Catholic country, except FRANCE, and there a trifling alteration will point out all the difference; - Instead of, the people full of superstition; note - The people full of themselves.</p>
               <p>'In HOLLAND, you might venture to suppose - The state, full of policy; the merchants, full of business; the common people, full of industry; and all ranks, full of selfish cunning.</p>
               <p>'So a foreigner at LONDON, will as readily suppose - the great ones, full of dissention; the people, full of discontent; the mob, full of insolence; a few, full of money; but all full of prodigality.</p>
               
            <pb n="262" xml:id="pb-262" facs="#i262"/>
               <p>'This, sir, may be called THE CLUE TO TRAVEL; leading you thro' the several turnings and windings of strange countries, with the utmost facility and dispatch; furnishing you with many things to talk of as long as you live, and from whence, by a due observance, you may profit in a few days, full as much as your humble servant has done before you.</p>
               <p>'Give me leave to add one caution, which is; That you never omit ticking off the last place you have visited, in the margin of your TOUR - and do it immediately, lest it escape your memory.</p>
               <p>'From a single omission of that kind, I had like to have got myself into an odd scrape; - for an Irish officer, with whom I was disputing about some fortification (I forget where) would have confronted me at last, that I had never been there at all.'</p>
               
            <pb n="263" xml:id="pb-263" facs="#i263"/>
               <p>Upon my shoul! honey! said he, but you give such a pretty, lame sort of an account of the plaesh; that, arrah! look you, the devil burn me! if I think you was ever within cannon-shot of it.</p>
               <p>'How! sir, said I - and told him all the circumstances about the dinner we had there: - But the fact was, as I found out afterwards by looking into my book; that in my hurry I had struck off one town, instead of another.'</p>
               <p>Your candour in this last instance, I confess, sir, is equal to your observations: - and if I comprehend you right, a Parisian might stay at home, and profit himself as much by reading THE COMPLETE GUIDE through LONDON and WESTMINSTER, as if he was to come among us.</p>
               <p>He would there find the names of all the squares, streets, lanes, courts, alleys - he might presently learn the</p>
               
            <pb n="264" xml:id="pb-264" facs="#i264"/>
               <p>rates of hackney-coachmen, chairmen, and watermen; and with a little application would know the inns where the carriers and stage-coaches put up; and their days of going out and coming in, as well as a warehouseman's book-keeper in Aldermanbury, or a grocer's porter in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>For to what purpose do we purchase books, and spend much time in reading them - but to profit ourselves by the industry of others.</p>
               <p>THE END OF PART II.</p>
