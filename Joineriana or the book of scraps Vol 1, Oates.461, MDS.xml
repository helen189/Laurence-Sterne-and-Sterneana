             <p>PREFACE.</p> <p>'JOINERIANA, or the BOOK of SCRAPS?' - Ay, or CARPENTERIANA, or the BOOK of CHIPS, if you had rather - or any other ANA you like.</p> <p>Call them SCRAPS, or Fragments; CHIPS or Shavings; waking Reflections, or wandering Imaginations, it matters not - so that some of them profit the reader,</p>
            <pb n="2" xml:id="pb-2" facs="#i8"/>
             <p>which is the principal aim of the writer.</p> <p>They are not gathered from PLUTARCH, LAERTIUS, STOBAEUS, ERASMUS - yet if there are any good among them, I have no doubt but they may be found in their collections.</p> <p>Neither can they owe much, to my knowledge, to LA BRUYERE and ROCHEFOUCAULT - yet, 'tis possible, many of the same sentiments occur in both: - But I am perfectly innocent of any charge of that kind, which may be brought against me - for, to the best of my</p>
            <pb n="3" xml:id="pb-3" facs="#i9"/>
             <p>remembrance, I have not looked into either of those much-admired wits these twenty years and upwards.</p> <p>They are not, I promise you, translations, or gleanings, or filings, or sweepings of ANAS.</p> <p>It follows then that they are mine: - Indeed I mean they should pass for such, in the full scope and import of the phrase - as, when a man says, 'That is mine' - he would be understood the matter to be questioned, was his property.</p>
            <pb n="4" xml:id="pb-4" facs="#i10"/>
             <p>In that just sense, I repeat, 'They are mine -' for was I conscious there were any sentiments throughout the book, which belonged to one man more than another, I would either restore them to the right owner, or expunge them altogether.</p> <p>But truths as truths, must belong to every man who is in search of TRUTH.</p> <p>Now seeing the book is mine, as I said before - for without the clearest conviction upon that head, I should never have thought of obtruding it upon the public -</p>
            <pb n="5" xml:id="pb-5" facs="#i11"/>
             <p>I have a right to assert my claim.</p> <p> - For, in my sense, 'tis the highest insult imaginable, that which is offered to the understanding - 'Tis an offence unpardonable! - </p> <p>What, are we to be bamboozled under false pretences and a specious shew of novelty, with the same things over and over, and over and over, and over and over again and again everlasting, and world without end?</p> <p>Then, I have a further conceit - The writer who improves me</p>
            <pb n="6" xml:id="pb-6" facs="#i12"/>
             <p>not, in some measure, leaves me in a worse condition than that in which he found me - far worse indeed! - for he has robbed me of TIME; which with all his wit and ingenuity, he can never make up to me.</p> <p>Think of this occasionally, my brethren - 'tis well worth a thought.</p> <p>And now I give up all further claim to the following SCRAPS of reflection, the fruits of few solitary hours - They are no longer mine; but yours and every body's.</p>
            <pb n="7" xml:id="pb-7" facs="#i13"/>
             <p>Accept them, gentle reader, with the same good will with which they are offered - peruse them with attention, and, if the author may so far presume, be confident it will be your own fault, if some of them do not turn out to your advantage.</p> <p>For you, ye Scriblers! I charge you, in the name of CANBOUR, that ye refrain from enlarging or diminishing the same - that you leave them to their own fate - that you make them not worse, under the notion of improving them - In fine, that ye mar not, in the rage of mending; neither</p>
            <pb n="8" xml:id="pb-8" facs="#i14"/>
             <p>mend, as is customary with you, for the sake of marring.</p> <p>For what advantage can ye propose to yourselves thereby?</p> <p>Money I know you want, as much as myself - But this is not a medley to make money by.</p> <p> - 'Tis too simple - neither is it voluminous enough: - Besides, in the body of the book, you may here and there catch a hint, which may answer your purpose much better.</p> <p>Then, I have another reason - </p>
            <pb n="9" xml:id="pb-9" facs="#i15"/>
             <p>This little work, you are to understand, is only thrown out as a specimen - a sort of a taste - and, if I find my customers relish it, I may possibly, as reflections arise, and time and occasion serve, enlarge it myself.</p> <p>The title of SCRAPS, I must own, is tempting! - for you are fond of SCRAPS to a man - and deal more in them, than in the Sirloin and Peck-loaf of Literature.</p> <p>From that consideration arises the caution I have given you.</p>

            <pb n="11" xml:id="pb-11" facs="#i17"/>
             <p>JOINERIANA.</p> <p>ANTIQUARY.</p> <p>THE sober and judicious Antiquary, professes a love of Antiquity upon the most laudable principles - a veneration of the wisdom and ingenuity of former times - the recovery of useful and interesting matter - the revival of lost art - and the establishing the best and most perfect models of science, or what promise to lead thereto, for the benefit of his own age and of posterity.</p>
            <pb n="12" xml:id="pb-12" facs="#i18"/>
             <p>He is not a mere eye-lover of Antiquity, but stands in the foremost rank of Critics.</p> <p>He knows how to chuse, what to reject - He is not easily persuaded to accept the counterfeit for the true - He sees no beauty in ugliness, no grace in deformity, no sense in nonsense, no real discovery in variable conjecture.</p> <p>What time has totally defaced, he commends once more to oblivion - He is well assured there is useful matter enough to employ his latest hours - for such he seeks, and such only.</p>
            <pb n="13" xml:id="pb-13" facs="#i19"/>
             <p>Not like the modern antiquary, who never tires - but from a single word, a proper name, an illegible legend, or broken and unpromising inscription, swells the vast volume with learned conjectures of his own and others - leaving his patient reader, in the conclusion, to decide to whom the stone or metal belonged.</p> <p>Whether it tends not to magnify some one character, heretofore debased? - or clears another form the smallest suspicion of having had a hand in certain measures - the history of which is unknown?</p> <p>Whether it establishes not the past existence of some person - who once lived and died? - or gives birth to another,</p>
            <pb n="14" xml:id="pb-14" facs="#i20"/>
             <p>who, without the profound study of this curious plodder, had never existed at all?</p> <p>Surely these Gentlemen do not always recollect, that there have been false marbles and lying inscriptions in all ages.</p> <p>If nothing interesting or useful is to be revived, the labour is lost in the search.</p> <p>To point out ashes, which had been long since mixed in the common mass of clay - to eke out inscriptions well nigh defaced; are proofs of patience, but not of generous parts.</p> <p>If the statue has shared the same fate with the statuary who made it, and him</p>
            <pb n="15" xml:id="pb-15" facs="#i21"/>
             <p>whose resemblance it once bore - (for marble will moulder with time, as well as men) - 'tis in vain to write conjectural dissertations upon fragments - upon noses and ears - upon fingers and toes.</p> <p>But the antiquary of our day, for the most part, usurps a title which does not belong to him - He is only a virtuoso - a lover of oddity - a hunter after nick-nacks.</p> <p>The subjects he collects recommend themselves by their singularity above every other consideration.</p> <p>'Did you ever see such a thing before? - I never did. - I wonder what it</p>
            <pb n="16" xml:id="pb-16" facs="#i22"/>
             <p>is! - What use can it be of? - How has it ever been applied? - </p> <p>'I fancy for this - I've a notion for that - and full as likely for t'other - But 'tis odd! - very singular indeed!</p> <p>'I would give as much as the first purchase cost me, with all my heart, to know what it means!</p> <p>'People bid up for it at Langford's, a if they'd been bewitched - because nobody could make head or tail of it!</p> <p>'All the company admired and were for it - because nobody understood it! - So I was resolved to possess the jewel, for the whim-sake, cost what it would!</p>
            <pb n="17" xml:id="pb-17" facs="#i23"/>

What is theft? - shall remain far less intelligible, than they were at first? - so that a jury of twelve honest men shall be confoundedly puzzled, to decide according to law, whether the culprit has been guilty of wickedly slaying, or stealing?</p> <p>No delinquent ought to profit by the error of an indictment - it may reflect upon the insufficiency or venality of some particular officer - but can in no-wise affect the criminality in question.</p> <p>Errors in indictments should be carefully guarded against - as often as they</p>

            <p>human error (in itself no less than a species of PERJURY) is to be winked at.</p> <p>Well-regulated Work-houses and Houses of Correction, were a sufficient punishment for many and early crimes - from the neglect of which, we hang in cartloads, and transport in ship-loads.</p> <p>In the course of the year, full as great a number find their account in the chicanery of the Law - as are benefited by the equitable determination thereof.</p> <p>The Law is so far a Lottery - that a man who gains his cause, of escapes the punishment which awaited his guilt; is said to have had GOOD LUCK: - for the odds at starting are seldom more or less against</p>

            <p>him, than as so many blanks to a prize in a Lottery.</p> <p>But so jealous are we of our Laws, upon a false supposition that our Liberties hang upon each letter, that we chuse to preserve them (even such as are manifestly dangerous and oppressive) in the same state; rather than set about amending, or abridging them, either in matter or method - 'For to amend and abridge, say they, is dangerous work!'</p> <p>This is the constant doctrine of Lawyers: - And who are such good judges of what is best - for themselves?</p> <p>'We have not half words enough, say they, as it is - so that we are obliged to</p>

            <p>run over the same again and again - What does the blockhead mean then by abridging?</p> <p>'Besides, shall we take upon us to new-frame and new-model, after my Lord COKE? - who has adjusted every thing almost a century and a half ago - </p> <p>' - Such pigmies in Law, as we are! - more especially now - when half the gowns in Westminster-Hall, were hardly sufficient to line one of his Lordship's sleeves!'</p> <p>But could such a Code, as I particularly contend for - a Code of concise Laws respecting common trespasses, be had - I should be content to leave the</p>

            <p>never lose sight, is left far behind - distinctions of ranks in society are introduced, and disproportioned penalties annexed - which in conclusions, brings it to this point - 'that no man is entitled to swear - having no money in his pocket.'</p> <p>SWEAR NOT AT ALL! is far more emphatical - </p> <p>The wretch who swears, profanes his MAKER'S name, and despises his GOD! - </p> <p>He who despises his GOD, will soon be brought to despise mankind and the laws - </p>

            <p>at all events - their passions gratified, their follies soothed above every other consideration.</p> <p>Hence flatterers, sharpers, jockies, mummers, knaves - are their sauces, companions, clever fellows, wits, and bosom friends.</p> <p>He has interest, my lord, and family connexion, who will leave no stone unturned - your lordship comprehends - </p> <p>'Perfectly well! - we must be beforehand with such, and prevent their solicitation - Nothing bespeaks a great man, like doing things with a grace!'</p>

            <p>Your Lordship desired me to remind you of Mr. PAM - </p> <p>'An excellent card! - But the rogue will shuffle and play false sometimes! - I have a vacant borough in my eye for him -'</p> <p>Did your Lordship read Lady Loo's letter? - </p> <p>'Pox on her! - I must get her a pension or a husband to get rid of her!'</p> <p>Captain TURF stands next. - </p> <p>'Set him down for a troop of dragoons! - That's an enterprizing fellow,</p>

MAKEFACE, my Lord, begins to fear your Lordship has forgot him! - but he spoke it with so much modesty, and such an infinite deal of wit and pleasantry! - </p> <p>'That's a comical cur! - What an inexhaustible fund of humour! - The keenest satirist - the most exquisite</p>

            <p>mimick in the universe, by Heaven! - If mock-patriotism don't demolish me, I stand a fair chance yet to die laughing, by some quaint recipe or other for the spleen, to be administered by my facetious Doctor MATTHEW, as I call him! - No, when I forget MATT, may my right hand forget her cunning! as somebody said.'</p> <p>The last words your Lordship did me the honour to pronounce yesterday, were - 'What shall we do with that blockhead, in whose veins a strange mixture of vicious and high-born blood, slowly circulates?' - And then, without waiting for my answer, your Lordship did me the honour - to run out of the room - </p>

            <p>'O - make him a Bishop - and put Learning out of countenance at once! - Confine the grovelings, say I, to their Schools and Colleges! - What business have such pedants among us? - men of no blood, nor interest, save what we confer upon them.'</p> <p>CHARLES COCKSPUR, my Lord, made a most brilliant figure at last NEWMARKET-Metting" - the envy of all the turf! - rode himself! - and started the finest horse upon the course! - </p> <p>'Did CHARLES? - then he shall be knighted, and start upon an embassy! - prick him down for -</p>

            <p>'Sir SIMON SNUG seems to have enjoyed the serene air and jovial income long enough - besides, his friends are all dropt, or fallen to t'other side - he may be recalled now with safety - Order CHARLES a service of plate directly - '</p> <p>But - I beg pardon, my Lord! - is your Lordship acquainted with his qualifications?</p> <p>'Have not you told me them already? - the man who can ride at such a rate, can surely run on errands - '</p> <p>Perhaps, my Lord, he won't go - </p> <p>'Then he may stay, and somebody else shall - But, I warrant you, he</p>
